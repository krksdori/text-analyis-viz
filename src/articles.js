	eArt: `<p> Africa, one of the four principal parts of the Earth. It measures approximately 800 leagues from Tangiers to Suez; 1420 from Cape Verde to Cape Guardafui; and 1450 from the Cape of Good Hope to Bone. Long. 1-71. lat. (southern) 1-35 and (northern) 1-37.30.</p>
	<p> There is little trading on the African coasts; the interior of this part of the world is still insufficiently known, and Europeans began trading only around the middle of the XIVth century. There is little trade between the Kingdoms of Morocco and Fez and the area near Cape Verde. Trading posts can be found around Cape Verde and between the Senegal and the Sierra Leone rivers. The coast of Sierra Leone has been explored by the four Nations, but only the Portuguese and the English have established posts. Only the English have a trading post near Cape Miserado. We do some trading along the Melegueta and Greve Coasts: we trade even more along "little Dieppe" and the grand Sestre. The Ivory (or Tusk) Coast is frequented by all Europeans; they almost all have Settlements and Forts along the Gold Coast. The Cape of Corsica is the main settlement of the English; there is little trade at Asdres. Many Negroes are taken from Benin and Angola. There is no activity in Kafir country. The Portuguese are established in Sofala, in Mozambique, in Madagascar. They also handle all the Malindi trade. We will follow the branches of this trade in the different articles Cape Verde, Senegal, etc.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4% of its total land area. With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.</p>
	<p> Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster – with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago. Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.</p>
	<p> Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. However, most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. African nations have attempted to cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p>
	<br><h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> Statue representing Africa at Palazzo Ferreria, in Valletta, Malta</p>
	<p> Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ʿafar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) "cave", in reference to cave dwellers. The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.</p>
	<p> Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya. The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p>
	<p> According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.</p>
	<p> Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":</p>
	<p> The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.</p>
	<p> Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the Latin aprica, meaning "sunny".</p>
	<p> Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian af-rui-ka, meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."</p>
	<p> Michèle Fruyt proposed linking the Latin word with africus "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".</p>
	<p> Robert R. Stieglitz of Rutgers University proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew Ophir."</p>

	<br><h4> Prehistory</h4>
	<p> Main article: Recent African origin of modern humans</p>
	<p> Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered 24 November 1974 in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Depression</p>
	<p> Africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the human species originating from the continent. During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BP, Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BP) and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.</p>
	<p> After the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers. These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco, or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.</p>
	<p> Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.</p>
	<p> The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions. At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia. However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification. The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.</p>
	<p> The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa. In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.</p>
	<p> Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.</p>
	<p> By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.</p>

	<p> At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt. One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC. Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.</p>
	<p> An independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.</p>
	<p> European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.</p>
	<p> Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.</p>
	<p> Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia; by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.</p>
	<p> In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.</p>

	<p> Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.</p>
	<p> By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.</p>
	<p> In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.</p>

	<p> The Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the Ooni of Ife. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.</p>
	<p> The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century. The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized, and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.</p>

	<p> Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship. By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.</p>

	<br><h3> Height of slave trade</h3>

	<p> Slavery had long been practised in Africa. Between the 7th and 20th centuries, Arab slave trade (also known as slavery in the East) took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean routes. Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World. More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.</p>
	<p> In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.</p>

	<p> Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers. The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of "legitimate commerce" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.</p>

	<p> In the late 19th century, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.</p>
	<br><h3> Berlin Conference</h3>
	<p> The Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.</p>
	<br><h3> Independence struggles</h3>
	<p> Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957), becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.</p>
	<p> Portugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.</p>
	<br><h3> Post-colonial Africa</h3>
	<p> Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country.</p>
	<p> Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.</p>
	<p> Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.</p>
	<p> South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the South African Border War</p>
	<p> Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund, also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse. The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.</p>
	<p> In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.</p>

	<p> A composite satellite image of Africa (centre) with North America (left) and Eurasia (right), to scale</p>
	<p> Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163 km (101 mi) wide. (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)</p>
	<p> From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (34°51'15" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000 km (5,000 mi); from Cape Verde, 17°33'22" W, the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in Somalia, 51°27'52" E, the most easterly projection, is a distance of approximately 7,400 km (4,600 mi). The coastline is 26,000 km (16,000 mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000 km2 (4,000,000 sq mi) – about a third of the surface of Africa – has a coastline of 32,000 km (20,000 mi).</p>
	<p> Africa's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast. The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.</p>
	<p> Geologically, Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula; the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia. The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo-Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the Afro-Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically.</p>
	<br><h3> Climate</h3>
	<p> Main article: Climate of Africa</p>
	<p> Africa map of Köppen climate classification</p>
	<p> The climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts. The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58 °C (136 °F)), was discredited in 2013.</p>
	<br><h3> Fauna</h3>
	<p> Main article: Fauna of Africa</p>
	<p> Savanna at Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania</p>
	<p> Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.</p>
	<br><h3> Ecology and biodiversity</h3>
	<p> Tropical beach in Trou-aux-Biches, Mauritius</p>
	<p> Africa has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.</p>
	<p> Deforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world. Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed. Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago. About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.</p>

	<br><h4> Politics</h4>
	<p> See also: List of political parties in Africa by country</p>
	<p> There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also Second Congo War). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.</p>
	<br><h3> The African Union</h3>
	<p> Map of the African Union with suspended states highlighted in light green</p>
	<p> Main article: African Union</p>
	<p> The African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002 as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.</p>
	<p> The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.</p>
	<p> Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.</p>

	<br><h4> Economy</h4>
	<p> Satellite image of city lights in Africa showing the lack of modern development on the continent (1994-1995)</p>
	<p> Main article: Economy of Africa</p>
	<p> Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide). According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.</p>
	<p> Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.</p>
	<p> Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973, indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.</p>
	<p> From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite, 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite. As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.</p>
	<p> In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.</p>
	<p> A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."</p>
	<p> During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.</p>
	<br><h4> Demographics</h4>
	<p> Main articles: African people and Demographics of Africa</p>

	<p> Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age. The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990. As of 2014, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time - India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.</p>
	<p> San Bushman man from Botswana</p>
	<p> Speakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa. But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan ("San" or "Bushmen") and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "Hottentots") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.</p>
	<p> The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.</p>
	<p> The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya. The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.</p>
	<p> Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa</p>
	<p> In the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.</p>
	<p> Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa. Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa), Kenya, Congo, Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola. Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone. Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa. The country with the largest white African population is South Africa. Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.</p>
	<p> European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.</p>
	<br><h4> Languages</h4>
	<p> By most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa. Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:</p>
	<p> •The Afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.</p>
	<p> •The Nilo-Saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.</p>
	<p> •The Niger–Congo language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps the largest in the world.</p>
	<p> •The Khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 400,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.</p>
	<p> Following the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.</p>
	<br><h4> Culture</h4>
	<p> The rock-hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
	<p> Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools. Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.</p>
	<p> Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art. According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, "The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art."  Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects "lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions. Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that "the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art."  In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur. Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the "traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe."  On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies." </p>
	<p> There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.</p>
	<br><h3> Visual art and architecture</h3>
	<p> African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago. The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.</p>
	<br><h3> Music and dance</h3>
	<p> Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.</p>
	<br><h3> Sports</h3>
	<p> Fifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.</p>
	<p> Cricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<br><h4> Religion</h4>
	<p> Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations. According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Islam is the largest religion in Africa, followed by Christianity. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baha'i, or Jewish. There is also a minority of Africans who are irreligious.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Arabia, a major region of Asia; a peninsula bordered to the west by the Red Sea, the Isthmus of Suez, the Holy Land, and Syria; to the north by the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf; to the east by the Ocean; to the south by the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. Arabia is divided into Petraea , Deserta , and Felix. Arabia Petraea , the smallest of the three, is mountainous and sparsely inhabited in its northern part, but it is populous and fairly fertile in its southern part. It was called Petraea after Petra , its ancient capital; Herac is the capital today. Arabia Deserta , so named after its terrain, is intersected by mountains and barren sand; Ana is its capital. Arabia Felix , called Yemen in Arabic, owes this epithet to its fertility; Sanaa is its capital. Arabs are Muslims; they are governed by emirs or sheikhs, each independent from the others but all dependent on the Sultan. Arabs are thieves and thugs. Longitude 52.77, latitude 12.34.</p>
	<p> When it comes to trade, Arabia Felix is basically the only one of the three where there is any. The cities of this country in which most of the trade occurs are Mocha, Hidedan, Chichiri, Zibet, and Ziden on the Red Sea; Aden and Fartack on the Arabian Ocean; Bahr, Barrhem, and Qatif along the Gulf of Basra; and finally, Basra. One might add Mecca and Medina, where devotion brings so many pilgrims and greed brings so many merchants. Commerce is maintained in these two cities by way of Ziden, which is actually the port of Mecca, and by Mocha, which serves as its warehouse.</p>
	<p> Mocha is at the entrance to the Red Sea; one can see vessels arriving there from Europe, Asia, and Africa; in addition to maritime commerce, there is also overland trade by way of caravans from Alep and Suez, which bring velvets, satins, armozeens, all sorts of sumptuous fabrics, saffron, mercury, vermilion, dry goods, etc.</p>
	<p> Part of what one brings home from there is the natural produce of the country, part the manufactured output, and part foreign merchandise that had been brought from the Indies, Africa, and Europe. The factories contribute some cotton fabrics; the country produces perfumes, incense, myrrh, ambergris, gems, aloe, balm, cinnamon, sap, [2] dragon’s blood, gum arabic, coral, and especially coffee.</p>
	<p> Aden used to enjoy all the commerce that is now done at Mocha. Ships from the Indies, Persia, Ethiopia, the Comoros islands, Madagascar, and Malindi are those most frequently seen at Chichiri.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia (Arabic: الجزيرة العربية‎‎ al-jazīra al-ʿarabiyya, « Arabian island ») is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate. From a geological perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia.</p>
	<p> It is the largest peninsula in the world, at 3,237,500 km2 (1,250,000 sq mi). The Arabian Peninsula consists of the countries Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and parts of Jordan and Iraq. The peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and southwest, the Persian Gulf to the northeast, the Levant to the north and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. The Arabian Peninsula plays a critical geopolitical role in the Middle East and the Arab world due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas.</p>
	<p> Before the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd, Southern Arabia(Hadhramaut) and Eastern Arabia. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf.</p>
	<br><h4> Geography</h4>
	<p> The Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and bounded by (clockwise) the Persian Gulf on the northeast, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman on the east, the Arabian Sea on the southeast and south, the Gulf of Aden on the south, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on the southwest and the Red Sea, which is located on the southwest and west. The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the Syrian Desert with no clear border line, although the northern boundary of the Arabian Peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p>
	<p> The most prominent feature of the peninsula is desert, but in the southwest there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Harrat ash Shaam is a large volcanic field that extends from the northwestern Arabian Peninsula into Jordan and southern Syria.</p>
	<br><h3> Political boundaries</h3>
	<p> The Arabian Peninsula.</p>
	<p> The peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise north to south) Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the east, Oman on the southeast, Yemen on the south and Saudi Arabia at the center. The island nation of Bahrain lies off the east coast of the peninsula.</p>
	<p> Six countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman) form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). However, this is a disputed term. Iranians assert that it is a historical and internationally recognized convention to name it the Persian Gulf, while Arab States, and most notably the six GCC member countries, have been claiming that the Gulf is Arabian since its shallow marine depths are a geological continuity of the Arabian peninsula's Eastern low-lying coasts, from Kuwait to the UAE's Northern Emirates.</p>
	<p> The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the peninsula. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. The peninsula contains the world's largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. Qatar, a small peninsula in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home of the Arabic-language television station Al Jazeera and its English-language subsidiary Al Jazeera English. Kuwait, on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
	<br><h3> Population</h3>
	<p> Though historically lightly populated, political Arabia is noted for a high population growth rate - as the result of both very strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years.</p>
	<p> In 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates).</p>
	<br><h2> Y-chromosome</h2>
	<p> Listed here are the human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups in Arabia (Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates)  </p>
	<p> Haplogroup J is the most abundant component in the Arabian peninsula, embracing more than 50% of its Y-chromosomes. Its two main subclades (J1-M267 and J2-M172), show opposite latitudinal gradients in the Middle East. J1-M267 is more abundant in the southern areas, reaching a frequency around 73% in Yemen, whereas J2-M172 is more common in the Levant.</p>
	<p> J (L222.2) Accounts for the majority of (L147.1) in Saudi Arabia. Seems to be an exclusively Adnani marker. Haplogroup J 54.8% Haplogroup E 17.5% R 11.6% Haplogroup T-M184 5.1%</p>
	<br><h3> Landscape</h3>
	<p> Salalah is a famous tourist destination in Arabia for its annual khareef season.</p>
	<p> Geologically, this region is perhaps more appropriately called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a tectonic plate of its own, the Arabian Plate, which has been moving incrementally away from the rest of Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the Eurasian plate (forming the Zagros mountains). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.</p>
	<p> The peninsula consists of:</p>
	<p> A central plateau, the Najd, with fertile valleys and pastures used for the grazing of sheep and other livestock</p>
	<p> A range of deserts: the Nefud in the north, which is stony; the Rub' al Khali or Great Arabian Desert in the south, with sand estimated to extend 600 ft (180 m) below the surface; between them, the Dahna</p>
	<p> In Hejaz, ranges of mountains, paralleling the Red Sea coast on the west (e.g. Asir province) but also at the southeastern end of the peninsula (Oman). The mountains show a steady increase in altitude westward as they get nearer to Yemen, and the highest peaks and ranges are all located in Yemen The highest, Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb in Yemen, is 3666 m high</p>
	<p> Stretches of dry or marshy coastland with coral reefs on the Red Sea side (Tihamah)</p>
	<p> Oases and marshy coast-land in Eastern Arabia on the Persian Gulf side</p>
	<p> Arabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called wadis, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient aquifers exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, oases form (e.g. Al-Hasa and Qatif, two of the world's largest oases) and permit agriculture, especially palm trees, which allowed the peninsula to produce more dates than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and arid, although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.</p>
	<p> According to NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data (2003 - 2013) analysed in a University of California, Irvine (UCI)-led study published in Water Resources Research on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water. Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers "have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted" and thirteen of them are "considered significantly distressed."</p>
	<p> A plateau more than 2,500 feet (760 m) high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterised by cuestas and valleys, drained by a system of wadis. A crescent of sand and gravel deserts lies to the east.</p>
	<br><h3> Land and sea</h3>
	<p> Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.</p>
	<p> The fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at 10,000 feet (3,000 m). In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and khat cultivation.</p>
	<p> The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.</p>
	<br><h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> During the Hellenistic period, the area was known as Arabia or Aravia (Greek: Αραβία). The Romans named three regions with the prefix "Arabia", encompassing a larger area than the current term "Arabian Peninsula":</p>
	<p> •Arabia Petraea: for the area that is today southern modern Syria, Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. It was the only one that became a province, with Petra as its capital.</p>
	<p> •Arabia Deserta ("Desert Arabia"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in Charles M. Doughty's Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888).</p>
	<p> •Arabia Felix ("Fortunate Arabia"): was used by geographers to describe what is now Yemen, which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.</p>
	<p> The Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.</p>
	<p> The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' – Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks). The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the subcontinent itself starting from Cilicia, where the Euphrates river makes its descent into Syria, through Palestine, and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.</p>
	<p> The provinces of Arabia were: Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.</p>
	<br><h4> History</h4>
	<p> The history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago. The region has twice in world history had a global impact. The first was in the 7th century when it became the cradle of Islam. The second was from the mid-20th century when the discovery of vast oil deposits propelled it into a key economic and geo-political role. At other times, the region existed in relative obscurity and isolation, although from the 7th century the cities of Mecca and Medina had the highest spiritual significance for the Islamic world, Mecca being the destination for the Hajj annual pilgrimage.</p>
	<br><h3> Pre-Islamic Arabia</h3>
	<p> There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about 106,000 to 130,000 years ago. However, the harsh climate historically prevented much settlement in pre-Islamic Saudi Arabia, apart from a small number of urban trading settlements, such as Mecca and Medina, located in the Hejaz in the west of the peninsula.</p>
	<p> However, archaeology has revealed the existence of many civilizations in pre-Islamic Arabia (such as Thamud), especially in South Arabia. South Arabian civilizations include Sheba, Himyarite Kingdom, Kingdom of Awsan, Kingdom of Ma'īn and Sabaean Kingdom. Central Arabia was the location of kingdom of Kinda in the 4th, 5th and early 6th centuries AD. Eastern Arabia was home to the Dilmun civilization. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the Peninsula into neighbouring areas.</p>
	<p> The Arabian peninsula has long been accepted as the original Urheimat of the Semitic languages by a majority of scholars.</p>
	<p> "Shamir of Dhu-Raydan and Himyar had called in the help of the clans of Habashat for against the kings of Saba; but Ilmuqah granted... the submission of Shamir of Dhu-Raydan and the clans of Habashat."</p>
	<br><h3> Rise of Islam</h3>
	<p> The seventh century saw the introduction of Islam to the Arabian Peninsula. The Islamic prophet Muhammad, was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but migrated to Medina in 622. From there he and his companions united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.</p>
	<p> He established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest Indian subcontinent, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees.</p>
	<p> Muhammad began preaching Islam at Mecca before migrating to Medina, from where he united the tribes of Arabia into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or "Wars of Apostasy".</p>
	<p> Following Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr became leader of the Muslims as the first Caliph. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the Ridda wars, or "Wars of Apostasy"), Abu Bakr attacked the Byzantine Empire. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by Umar as caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. The period of these first four caliphs is known as al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn: the Rashidun or "rightly guided" Caliphate. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their Umayyad successors, the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the Byzantine army and destroyed the Persian Empire, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian peninsula to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.</p>
	<p> Nevertheless, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur'an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime. The Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca is the location of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, and the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque) in Medina is the location of Muhammad tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, Mecca and Medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world.</p>
	<br><h3> The Middle Ages</h3>
	<p> Despite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the Islamic world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo.</p>
	<p> However, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the Hejaz. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the Hejaz. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the Hejaz, they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the Abbasids of Baghdad, and the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks of Egypt.</p>
	<br><h3> Modern history</h3>
	<p> Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 (See: list of territories).</p>
	<p> The provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in Syria, which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon (Mount Lebanon was however a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate). It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula. The Ottomans never had any control over central Arabia, also known as the Najd region.</p>
	<p> The Damascus Protocol of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of Hejaz, asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised Cilicia – İskenderun and Mersin, Iraq with Kuwait, Syria, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Jordan, and Palestine.</p>
	<p> In the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as 'jazirat al-Arab', or the peninsula of the Arabs.</p>
	<br><h2> Late Ottoman rule and the Hejaz Railway</h2>
	<p> In the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.</p>
	<p> The Hejaz Railway was a narrow gauge railway (1050 mm) that ran from Damascus to Medina, through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of Mecca, but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the Ottoman railway network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul an<d Damascus (which began from the Haydarpaşa Terminal).</p>
	<p> The railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II and was built largely by the Turks, with German advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a waqf, an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.</p>
	<br><h2> The Arab Revolt and the unification of Saudi Arabia</h2>
	<p> The major developments of the early 20th century were the Arab Revolt during World War I and the subsequent collapse and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) was initiated by the Sherif Hussein ibn Ali with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Empire and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.</p>
	<p> These events were followed by the unification of Saudi Arabia under King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured Riyadh. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, Jabal Shammar, Hejaz between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis absorbed the Emirate of Asir, with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a war with Yemen. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.</p>
	<br><h2> Oil reserves</h2>
	<p> The second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of Yemen.</p>
	<br><h2> Civil war in Yemen</h2>
	<p> The North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d'état carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Muhammad al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.</p>
	<p> The royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.</p>
	<p> By 1970, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their Vietnam.</p>
	<br><h2> Gulf War</h2>
	<p> In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces led to the 1990–91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called "Damascus Declaration" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.</p>
	<br><h4> Transport and industry</h4>
	<p> The extraction and refining of oil and gas are the major industrial activities in the Arabian Peninsula. The region also has an active construction sector, with many cities reflecting the wealth generated by the oil industry. The service sector is dominated by financial and technical institutions, which, like the construction sector, mainly serve the oil industry. Traditional handicrafts such as carpet-weaving are found in rural areas of Arabia.</p>`

	<p> Aristocracy, asort of political government administered by a small number of the noble and wise;  ἄρης, Mars , or powerful , or from ἄριστος, very good , very strong , and from κράτος, force , power , or the power of the great. Authors who have written on politics prefer aristocracy to all other forms of government. The Republic of Venice and that of Genoa are governed by nobles, the people being excluded. It would seem that aristocracies and oligarchies have much in common with one another; although an oligarchy is only a vitiated aristocratic government, since in the oligarchy the administration, entrusted to a small number of persons, is found concentrated in one or two , who dominate over all of the others.</p>
	<p> As for the laws relative to aristocracy  , one may consult the excellent work of Monsieur de Montesquieu. Here are the principle ones:</p>
	<p> 1. In an aristocracy , the body of nobles casting votes, these votes cannot be too secretive.</p>
	<p> 2. Suffrage must not be given by lot; only inconveniences would result from it. Indeed, once distinctions that raise a few citizens above the others are estabpshed, even if one were chosen by lot, one would not be less odious because of it. It is not the magistrate, but the noble that one envies.</p>
	<p> 3. When nobles are numerous, there must be a senate that regulates the affairs which the body of nobles will not be able to decide and that prepares that on which it rules; in that case, one might say that aristocracy is in a way, in the senate, democracy in the body of nobles, and that the people are nothing.</p>
	<p> 4. It will be a very good thing in an aristocracy , if by some indirect measure the people are freed from annihilation. Thus in Genoa the Bank of Saint George, which is directed by the people, gives them a certain influence in the government, from which all of their prosperity is derived.</p>
	<p> 5. The Senators must not have the right to fill empty seats in the senate; it is up to the Censors to name new Senators, if one does not wish to perpetuate abuse.</p>
	<p> 6. The best aristocracy is that in which the portion of the population who have no power is so inconsiderable and poor, that those who dominate have no interest in oppressing them.</p>
	<p> 7. The most imperfect is that in which the portion of the people who obey are in a state of civil servitude to those who rule.</p>
	<p> 8. If in an aristocracy the people are virtuous, they will always enjoy, more a less, a feeling of contentment equal to that of a popular government, and the state will become powerful.</p>
	<p> 9. The spirit of moderation is what one calls virtue in an aristocracy ; it takes there the place of equality in a popular state.</p>
	<p> 10. The modesty and simplicity of manners constitute the strength of aristocratic nobles.</p>
	<p> 11. If the nobles had personal and individual prerogatives, distinct from the corporative body, an aristocracy would diverge from its nature and its principle, in order to take those of monarchy.</p>
	<p> 12. There are two principle sources of disorder in aristocratic states: excessive inequality between those who govern and those who are governed, and inequality among those who govern.</p>
	<p> 13. The first of these inequalities will occur if the privileges of the principal  are honorable only because they are shameful to the people, and if the condition relative to taxes is different among citizens.</p>
	<p> 14. Commerce is the profession of equal persons; the nobles must therefore not participate in trade in an aristocracy.</p>
	<p> 15. The laws must be such that the nobles are constrained to render justice to the people.</p>
	<p> 16. They must mortify entirely the desire to dominate.</p>
	<p> 17. It is necessary that there be, either temporarily or perpetually, an authority that is feared by the nobles.</p>
	<p> 18. Extreme poverty of nobles  exorbitant riches of nobles  pernicious in an aristocracy.</p>
	<p> 19. There must be no primogeniture among nobles, so that the distribution of inheritances always levels the members of this order into approximate equality.</p>
	<p> 20. It is necessary that disputes that arise among the nobles not last long.</p>
	<p> 21. The laws must tend to abolish the distinctions that vanity raises among noble families.</p>
	<p> 22. If  are good, they will bring about more of a feeling among the nobles of the inconveniences of ruling than of its benefits.</p>
	<p> 23. Aristocracy will be corrupted when the power of nobles having become arbitrary, there will no longer be virtue in those who govern, or in those who are governed. See l’Esprit des lois , pp. 1ff., 13ff., 114ff., where these maxims are supported by ancient and modern examples, which hardly permit one to contest their truthfulness.</p>
	<p> This is the end of Mallet’s contribution. The rest of the article, denoted by the asterisk, is by Diderot.</p>
	<p>  Most points in the list are paraphrased selections from Montesquieu's commentary on aristocracy in l’Esprit des lois.</p>`,
	wArt:`
	<p> Aristocracy (Greek ἀριστοκρατία aristokratía, from ἄριστος aristos "excellent," and κράτος kratos "power") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class. The term derives from the Greek aristokratia, meaning "rule of the best".</p>
    <p> At the time of the word's origins in Ancient Greece, the Greeks conceived it as rule by the best qualified citizens—and often contrasted it favourably with monarchy, rule by an individual. In later times, aristocracy was usually seen as rule by a privileged group, the aristocratic class, and was contrasted with democracy.</p>
    <br>
    <h4> Concept</h4>
    <p> The concept evolved in Ancient Greece, whereby a council of leading citizens was commonly empowered and contrasted with direct democracy, in which a council of citizens was appointed as the "senate" of a city state or other political unit. The Greeks did not like the concept of monarchy, and as their democratic system fell, aristocracy was upheld.</p>
    <p> In Ancient Rome, the Republic consisted of an aristocracy—as well as consuls, a senate, and a tribal assembly. In the Middle Ages and early modern era, aristocracies primarily consisted of an influential aristocratic class, privileged by birth, and often by wealth, land and property. Since the French Revolution, aristocracy has generally been contrasted with democracy, in which all citizens should hold some form of political power. However, this distinction is often oversimplified.</p>
    <p> The aristocracy frequently were warriors who gained land by conquest and the rights of land or real property could not be repossessed, foreclosed or sold as a result of defaulting on debt or place monetary value on them because they were tied up with various ancient traditions. This system was called feudalism, a formal set of obligations to lords, dukes, kings and other warrior caste nobles which may include patronage to traditionally valued guilds or professions, bestowing rights, protection or heritable property under fiefdoms. In exchange feudal aid is received from tenants or vassals, oaths of military allegiance and administration services. However an oligarchy, nobility or royalty had the right to set taxes, assemble or raise armies and command loyalty (fealty) by virtue of traditional authority.</p>
    <p> Aristocrats as a hereditary or self-made noble social class represented ideals such as Roman virtues e.g., Auctoritas (spiritual authority); Pietas or duty/dutifulness, loyalty, piousness and honor; Virtus or courage, valor and character; and Iustitia (justice).</p>
    <p> In the 1651 book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes describes an aristocracy as a commonwealth in which the representative of the citizens is an assembly by part. It is a system in which only a small part of the population represents the government. Modern depictions of aristocracy tend to regard it not as the ancient Greek concept of rule by the best, but more as a plutocracy—rule by the rich.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Art. Abstract metaphysical term. Men began by collecting observations on the nature, function, use and qualities of beings and their symbols. Then they gave the name of science or art to the center or focal point to which they linked the observations they had made, in order to create a system of instruments, or of rules which were all directed toward the same object. That is the most general meaning of art. To give an example: Men reflected on the usage and function of words and subsequently invented the word "grammar." Grammar is the name of a system of instruments and rules that relate to a specific object; this object is articulated sound. The same is true of the other arts and sciences. See Abstraction.</p>
	<p> Origin of the arts and sciences. In pursuit of his needs, luxury, amusement, satisfaction of curiosity, or other objectives, man applied his industriousness to the products of nature and thus created the arts and sciences. The focal points of our different reflections have been called "science" or "art" according to the nature of their "formal" objects, to use the language of logic. See Object. If the object leads to action, we give the name of "art" to the compendium of the rules governing its use and to their technical order. If the object is merely contemplated under different aspects, the compendium and technical order of the observations concerning this object are called "science." Thus metaphysics is a science and ethics is an art. The same is true of theology and pyrotechnics.</p>
	<p> Speculative and practical aspects of an art. From the preceding it is evident that every art has its speculative and its practical aspect: the former consists in knowing the principles of an art, without their being applied, the latter in their habitual and unthinking application. It is difficult if not impossible to go far in the practice of an art without speculation, and, conversely, to have a thorough knowledge of the speculative aspects of an art without being versed in its practice. In every art there are many particulars concerning its material, its instruments, and its application which can only be learned through practice. It is the function of practice to present difficulties and phenomena, while speculation must explain the phenomena and solve the difficulties. Consequently, only an artist who can think logically can talk well about his art.</p>
	<p> Division of the arts into liberal and mechanical arts. When men examined the products of the arts, they realized that some were primarily created by the mind, others by the hands. This is part of the cause for the pre-eminence that some arts have been accorded over others, and of the distinction between liberal and mechanical arts. This distinction, although it is quite justified, has led to bad consequences because it has given a low name to people who are very worthy and useful, and encouraged us in a certain natural laziness. We are all too inclined to believe that it is beneath the dignity of the human spirit to apply oneself diligently and continuously to specific and concrete experiments and objects, and that our mind forfeits its dignity when it descends to the study, let alone the practice, of the mechanical arts; the mind here stoops to questions in which research is laborious, reflection inglorious, and exposition difficult; such questions are dishonorable to deal with, countless in number, and of scarcely any value. Minui majestatem mentis humanae, si in experimentis et rebus particularibus, etc. (Bacon, Novum Organum). [2] This prejudice has tended to fill the cities with useless spectators and with proud men engaged in idle speculation, and the countryside with petty tyrants who are ignorant, lazy, and disdainful. Such was not the thinking of Bacon, one of the foremost geniuses of England, nor of Colbert, one of the greatest ministers of France, nor, in a word, of the right-thinking and sensible men of all times. Bacon considered the history of the mechanical arts the most important branch of true philosophy; therefore he certainly did not scorn its practice. Colbert considered the industry of the people and the founding of manufactures the most reliable resource of a kingdom. In the opinion of those who today can discern true worth, the state benefited no less from a man who filled France with engravers, painters, sculptors, and artists of all types, who wrested from the English the secret of the machine for producing hosiery, from the Genoese their velvet, from the Venetians their mirrors, than it benefited from those who vanquished the enemies of France and took their fortresses. In the eyes of a philosopher a sovereign may deserve more praise if he has encouraged men like Le Brun, Le Sueur, and Audran, [3] if he has had the battles of Alexander painted and engraved, and the victories of our generals represented in tapestry, than he would for having gained those victories. Place on one side of the scales the actual advantages of the most sublime sciences and the most honored arts, and on the other side the advantages of the mechanical arts, and you will find that esteem has not been accorded to the one and to the other in just proportion to the benefits they bring. You will discover that far more praise has been heaped on those men who spend their time making us believe that we are happy, than on those who actually bring us happiness. How strangely we judge! We expect everyone to pass his time in a useful manner, and we disdain useful men.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p> General purpose of the arts. Man is only the minister or interpreter of nature: he can only understand or act insofar as he has knowledge of the beings that surround him, either by means of experiment or reflection. His bare hand can only achieve a small number of effects, however robust, tireless, and supple it may be; it succeeds in great enterprises only with the help of instruments and rules. The same is true of the understanding. It is as if instruments and rules provided additional muscles for the arms, and additional energy for the mind. The general purpose of any art, or of any system of instruments and rules concurring toward the same end, is to impress specific forms onto the basic element provided by nature. This element can be either matter, or spirit, or some function of the soul, or some product of nature. However, I shall devote most of my attention to the mechanical arts, particularly because other authors have written little about them. In these arts man's power is limited to moving natural objects closer or farther away. Man is capable of everything or nothing, depending on whether it is or is not possible to bring objects closer or move them farther away (see Bacon, Novum Organum).</p>
	<p> A project for a general treatise on the mechanical arts. Often we do not know the origin of a mechanical art or have only vague information on its progress. That is the natural consequence of the scorn in which those who engage in these arts have been held at all times and in every learned or warlike nation. In such a situation we must have recourse to philosophic suppositions, begin from some probable hypothesis, from some first fortuitous event, and proceed from there until we reach the point to which the art has advanced. I shall explain this by an example, and I prefer to take it from the mechanical arts, which are not so well known, rather than from the liberal arts which have been described in a thousand different ways. If the origin and progress of glassmaking or papermaking were unknown, what would a philosopher do if he intended to write the history of these arts? He would suppose that a piece of cloth had accidentally fallen into a container filled with water and had remained in it long enough to dissolve, so that when the container was emptied it was found to have in it, instead of a piece of cloth, only a kind of sediment. It would have been difficult to determine the nature of that sediment, had it not been for a few remaining filaments which indicated that the original matter of the sediment had been cloth. As far as glassmaking is concerned, he would suppose that the first solid dwellings built by men were made of baked clay or brick. Now it is impossible to burn brick in a strong fire without some part of it vitrifying, and it is in this form that glass first occurred. But how far removed this dirty greenish shard is from the pure, transparent matter used in windows, etc.! Yet this or a similar fortuitous happening is the starting point from which the philosopher will proceed to the present state of glassmaking.</p>
	<p> Advantages of this method. By this procedure the progress of an art would be presented in a clearer and more instructive manner than by its true history, if that were known. The difficulties that had to be overcome to improve the art would occur in an entirely natural order, the synthetic explanation of its successive steps would render it comprehensible even for very average minds, and this would divert artists onto the path leading to perfection.</p>
	<p> The order that would have to be followed in such a treatise. As for the order that would have to be followed in such a treatise, I believe that it would be most advantageous to link the arts to the products of nature. An exact enumeration of these products would give rise to many arts that are as yet unknown. A detailed examination of the different aspects from which the same product can be studied would lead to the discovery of still other arts. The first of these possibilities demands a very extensive knowledge of natural history and the second, great dialectical ability. Consequently, a treatise on the arts, as I envisage it, cannot be the work of an ordinary man. Let no one imagine that I am engaged in idle speculation and that the discoveries I promise are mere figments of my imagination. I have already pointed out that the history of nature is incomplete without the history of the arts, and here I echo a philosopher [Bacon] whom I never tire of praising because I never tire of reading him. I have already suggested to the naturalists that they perfect their studies of the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms by including the experiments of the mechanical arts, a branch of knowledge much more important for true philosophy. Now I shall dare to add with him: Ergo rem quam ago, non opinionem, sed opus esse; eamque non sectae alicujus, aut placiti, sed utilitatis esse et amplitudinis immensae fundamenta. [4] We are not dealing here with a philosophical system nor with the whims of one man, but with the decrees of experience and of reason and the foundation of an immense edifice. Whoever thinks otherwise seeks to limit the sphere of our knowledge and to discourage men's minds. We owe to chance very important discoveries we did not actively seek. Should we assume that we will not find anything if we add our efforts to the whims of chance and introduce order and method into our research? If we now possess secrets that men formerly did not hope to uncover, and if we may conjecture from the experience of the past, why should the future not hold riches for us that we can scarcely count on today? If, a few centuries ago, anyone had said to those people who measure possibilities by the reach of their genius and who do not imagine anything beyond what they already know, that there exists a dust that breaks rocks and overthrows the thickest walls from an unbelievable distance, that a few pounds of this dust, enclosed in the depths of the earth, shake the earth, make their way through the enormous mass that covers them, and open up an abyss large enough to contain an entire city, these people would certainly have compared such effects to the action of wheels, pulleys, levers, counterweights, and other known machines; they would have declared that such a dust is a mere figment of the imagination and that only lightning, or the cause that produces earthquakes by means of an inimitable mechanism, can produce such fearful prodigies. Thus we may conclude that the great philosopher spoke to his century and to all the centuries to come. We may ask, as he would have done, how much erroneous speculation would have been occasioned by the project of raising water by fire, as was carried out for the first time in London, [5] especially if the inventor of the machine would have modestly presented himself as a man little versed in mechanics? If this were the only attitude toward inventions nothing either great or small would be produced. Men who render hasty judgments upon inventions that do not deviate from established practice and sometimes are merely slight modifications of familiar machines, requiring at most a skillful worker to carry them out, men, I repeat, who are so narrow-minded that they judge these inventions to be impossible, should know that they themselves are not learned enough to formulate appropriate aspirations. The chancellor Bacon tells them so: Qui sumpta , or what is even more inexcusable, qui neglecta ex his quae praesto sunt conjectura, ea aut impossibilia, aut minus verisimilia, putet; eum scire debere se non satis doctum, ne ad optandum quidem commode et apposite esse. [6]</p>
	<p> Another reason for carrying on research. We ought also to be encouraged in our research and prompted to look attentively around us, since so many centuries have gone by without men becoming aware of important things which they had, so to speak, right before their eyes, such as the arts of printing and engraving. How strange is the condition of the human mind! During the act of discovery it mistrusts its strength, it becomes entangled in self-created difficulties and what it seeks seems impossible to find. Once the discovery is made, the mind no longer conceives why it was necessary to seek so long, and feels sorry for its inadequacy.</p>
	<p> Remarkable differences between machines. Having now set forth my ideas concerning a philosophic treatise on the arts in general, I am going to continue with some useful remarks on the manner of treating certain mechanical arts individually. Sometimes we use a very complex machine to produce an effect that appears quite simple; at other times a machine that is really very simple produces by itself a very complex action. In the first case one must begin by stating the effect to be produced, since it is easily grasped and will not burden one's memory with knowledge nor confuse one's mind. The description of the machine will then follow. In the second case, on the contrary, it is more to the point to go from the description of the machine to knowledge of its effect. The effect of a clock is to divide time into equal parts with the aid of a needle that moves evenly and very slowly on a marked surface. If then I show a clock to someone who does not know this machine, I will first explain its effects and will then deal with its mechanism. I shall certainly not proceed in the same manner with someone who asks me what a stocking-stitch is, or cloth, or drugget, or velvet, or satin. Here I would begin with a detailed description of the frames on which these materials are produced. If the construction of the machine is clear, its effect is grasped all at once, something that might be impossible without this preliminary explanation. Anyone who would like to convince himself of the truth of these remarks should try to define exactly what gauze is, without presupposing any knowledge of the machine of the gauze-maker.</p>
	<p> Of the geometry of the arts. Everyone will readily agree that there are few artists who can dispense with the elements of mathematics. Yet here we have a paradox, although its truth is not immediately obvious: in many situations knowledge of these elements would actually hamper an artist if, in practice, the precepts of mathematics were not corrected by an extensive knowledge of physical circumstances; such as location, position, irregular figures, materials and their qualities, elasticity, rigidity, friction, consistency, duration, as well as the effects of air, water, cold, heat, dryness, and so forth. It is clear that the elements of academic geometry constitute only the simplest and least complex elements of workshop geometry. There exists not one lever in nature that is the same as the one which Varignon presupposes in his propositions; [7] there exists not one lever in nature whose factors can all be calculated. Among these factors we find a great number, some of them very essential in practice, which cannot even be subjected to the mathematical operations by which we determine the slightest discernible differences of quantity. Hence a man who knows only theoretical geometry is usually not skillful, and an artist who knows only experimental geometry is very limited as a worker. But, in my opinion, experience shows us that it is easier for an artist to get along without theoretical geometry than for any man to get along without some experimental geometry. In spite of calculus the entire subject of friction has remained the province of experimental and practical mathematics. It is remarkable how far we can go with only this mathematics. How many bad machines are suggested every day by men who imagine that levers, wheels, pulleys, and cables perform in a machine as they do on paper! Because they have taken part in practical work, they have never learned the difference between the effects of the machine itself and of its section. We will add a second observation since the subject suggests it: there are machines that are successful on a small scale but not on a large scale. Of some others the opposite is true. I believe that the latter should include all the machines whose effect depends principally on the considerable weight of their component parts, on the force of reaction in a fluid, or on a great volume of elastic matter upon which these machines have to act. If one constructs them on a small scale, the weight of the parts is reduced to nothing, the reaction of the fluid is almost nonexistent, the forces on which one has counted disappear and the machine is ineffective. However, just as there is a point, if we may use the term, a limit that stands in relation to the size of the machine, where it ceases to be effective, there is another below or beyond which the potential of its mechanism does not produce its maximum effect. Every machine has, in the language of geometry, a maximum size. When we consider each part in relation to its most perfect functioning, it has a size that is determined by the other parts. Similarly, from the point of view of its most perfect functioning, the whole has a size determined by the machine, by its intended use, and by an infinity of other matters. But where, you will ask, is the limit in the dimensions of a machine, beyond or below which it is either too large or too small? Which is the actual and absolute size of an excellent watch, a perfect mill, or a ship of the best possible construction? To give us an approximate solution to these problems, we need the experimental and practical geometry of several centuries, assisted by the most subtle theoretical geometry, I am convinced that it is impossible to obtain any satisfactory result when these types of geometry are kept separate, and that it is very difficult to do so even when they are combined.</p>
	<p> Of the language of the arts. I have found the language of the arts to be very imperfect for two reasons: the scarcity of proper nomenclature and the frequency of synonyms. Some tools have several different names while others have only the generic name "engine" or "machine," without any additional name to distinguish them. At times an insignificant difference is enough to make artists invent specific names to substitute for the generic name. At other times a tool that is distinctive because of its form and use either has no name or is given the name of another tool with which it has nothing in common. One would wish for more attention to analogy of form and use. Geometers do not have as many names as they have figures, but in the arts a hammer, a pair of tongs, a bucket, a shovel, etc., have almost as many names as there are arts. A good part of the language changes from manufacture to manufacture. Yet I am convinced that the most unusual operations and the most complex machines could be explained by a rather small number of familiar, well-known terms, if it were decided to use technical terms only when they communicate a distinctive idea. What I am saying must carry conviction for anyone who considers that complex machines are only combinations of simple machines, that there are few simple machines, and that in the description of any operation all the movements can be reduced, without any significant error, to rectilinear and circular movements. It would be desirable if a good logician, well versed in the arts, undertook to describe the elements of a "grammar of the arts." For a first step he would have to determine the value of the correlatives "big," "large," "average," "thin," "thick," "slight," "small," "light," "heavy," etc. For this purpose one must seek a constant measure in nature or evaluate the height, width, and average force of man, and relate to it all indeterminate expressions of quantity, or at the least set up tables to which artists would be asked to make their language conform. The second step would be to decide on the differences and similarities between the form and the use of one instrument and another, between one operation and another, in order to determine when these should keep the same name and when they should be given different names. I do not doubt that anyone who undertakes this task will find it necessary to eliminate synonyms rather than to introduce new terms. I am also sure that it is more difficult to give a good definition of common terms, such as "elegance" in painting, "knot" in trimming, "hollow" in several arts, than it is to explain the most complicated machines. It is the lack of precise definitions and the great number, not the diversity, of movements in various operations that makes it difficult to speak clearly about the arts. The only remedy for the second problem is to familiarize oneself with the objects: they are well worth the trouble whether we think of the advantages they bring us or of the fact that they do honor to the human mind. In what physical or metaphysical system do we find more intelligence, discernment, and consistency than in the machines for drawing gold or making stockings, and in the frames of the braid-makers, the gauzemakers, the drapers, or the silk workers? What mathematical demonstration is more complicated than the mechanism of certain clocks or the different operations to which we submit the fiber of hemp or the chrysalis of the silkworm before obtaining a thread with which we can weave? What projection is more beautiful, more subtle, and more unusual than the projection of a design onto the threads of a simple and from there onto the threads of a warp? What can conceivably be more subtle than the art of shadowing velvet? I could never enumerate all the marvels that amaze anyone who looks at factories, unless his eyes are closed by prejudice or stupidity.</p>
	<p> I shall follow the example of the English philosopher and mention three inventions that were unknown to the ancients. It is to the shame of modern history and poetry that the names of their inventors are scarcely known. I am speaking of the art of printing, the discovery of gunpowder, and the properties of the magnetic needle. What a revolution these discoveries have brought about in the republic of letters, in military art, and in seafaring! The magnetic needle has led our ships to the most remote regions, typographic characters have created enlightened communication between learned men of all countries and all future time, and gunpowder has occasioned all the architectural masterpieces that defend our frontiers as well as those of our enemies; these three arts have almost transformed the face of the earth.</p>
	<p> Let us finally render artists the justice that is their due. The liberal arts have sung their own praise long enough; they should now raise their voice in praise of the mechanical arts. The liberal arts must free the mechanical arts from the degradation in which these have so long been held by prejudice, while royal protection must save them from the indigent state in which they still languish. The artisans have thought they deserved disdain because they were in fact disdained; let us teach them to think better of themselves, only then can we obtain more perfect products from them! We would wish that from the halls of the academies there would emerge a man who would go into the workshops, record everything noteworthy about the arts, and set it forth in a work that would induce the artists to read, the philosophers to think usefully, and the nobles to begin exercising their authority and their munificence in a useful manner.</p>
	<p> If we may give some advice to learned men, we would suggest that they practice what they teach, namely not to judge too hastily nor to condemn an invention as useless because in its early stages it does not bring all the advantages that could be expected of it. If Montaigne, who in other ways was so much of a philosopher, returned among us, he would blush to have written that "firearms are so little effective, except in deafening our ears—to which everyone has become accustomed" that he hopes they will drop out of use. [8] Would he not have shown greater wisdom if he had encouraged the harquebusiers of his time to replace the match and wheellock by some machine activated by gunpowder? And would he not have shown more perspicacity if he had predicted that one day such a machine would be invented? Imagine Bacon in the place of Montaigne: you would see him study the nature of the agent and prophesy, if I may say so—grenades, mines, cannons, bombs, and the entire apparatus of military pyrotechnics. However, Montaigne is not the only philosopher who decided too hastily whether a machine is possible or impossible. Descartes, that extraordinary genius who was born both to confuse and to lead men, and many others, who were certainly the equals of the author of the Essais , maintained that the mirror of Archimedes was a fiction. Yet this mirror is exhibited in the Jardin du Roi for all learned men to see. M. Buffon, who rediscovered it, is using it so successfully that we can no longer doubt the results which Archimedes is supposed to have achieved with it, on the walls of Syracuse. [9] Such great examples suffice to render us circumspect.</p>
	<p> On the other hand we invite the artists to take counsel with learned men and not to allow their discoveries to perish with them. The artists should know that to lock up a useful secret is to render oneself guilty of theft from society. It is just as despicable to prefer the interest of one individual to the common welfare in this case as in a hundred others where the artists themselves would not hesitate to decide for the common good. If they communicate their discoveries they will be freed of several preconceptions and especially of the illusion, which almost all of them hold, that their art has reached its ultimate perfection. Because they have so little learning they are often inclined to blame the nature of things for a defect that exists only in themselves. Obstacles seem insuperable to them whenever they do not know the means of overcoming them. Let them carry out experiments and let everyone make his contribution to these experiments: the artist should contribute his work, the academician his knowledge and advice, the rich man the cost of materials, labor, and time; soon our arts and our manufactures will be as superior as we could wish to those of other countries.</p>
	<p> Of the superiority of one process of manufacture over another. But the superiority of one process over another will depend primarily on the quality of the materials used, together with the speed of work and the perfection of workmanship. The quality of the materials must be assured by inspection. As for the speed of work and the perfection of workmanship, they depend only on the number of workers brought together. When a process of manufacture employs many workers, each operation will be the responsibility of a different man. A particular workman will spend his lifetime performing one single operation; hence each operation is carried out quickly and well, and moreover the best-made product is also the cheapest. It is also true that when a great number of workers are assembled, taste and workmanship necessarily improve because there will be some who are able to reflect, put facts together, and discover the only way to surpass their fellow workers: they must economize on materials, make better use of time, or excel in inventiveness. This they can do by introducing either a new machine or a more practical process. If foreign industry does not surpass our manufacture in Lyon, it is not because our processes are unknown elsewhere; everywhere we find the same looms, the same silks, and more or less the same practices, but only in Lyon are there thirty thousand workers assembled, all working on the manufacture of the same material.</p>
	<p> We could make this article even longer, but what we have already said suffices for those readers who know how to think, and we could never write an article long enough for the others. Perhaps in some places people will find our metaphysics too daring, but that was inevitable. We had to speak of art in general and, consequently, had to deal in generalizations. Good sense tells us, however, that the more general a proposition the more abstract it is, since abstraction consists in extending a truth by eliminating from its statement terms that particularize it. If only we could have spared the reader these thorny passages, we would have spared ourselves a great deal of work.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.</p>
	<p> The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>
	<p> Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science". Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation.</p>
	<p> The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.</p>
	<br><h4> Creative art and fine art</h4>
	<p> In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.</p>

	<p> Few modern scholars have been more divided than Plato and Aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art, with Aristotle strongly supporting art in general and Plato generally being opposed to its relative importance. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.</p>
	<p> The second, and more recent, sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art.</p>
	<p> Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.</p>
	<p> Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.</p>
	<p> The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle. Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R.G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the art world" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation". Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."</p>
	<br><h4> History</h4>
	<p> Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave. Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years. Etched shells by Homo erectus from 430,000 and 540,000 years ago were discovered in 2014.</p>

	<p> Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.</p>
	<p> In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.</p>
	<p> Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.</p>
	<p> The stylized signature of Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire was written in Islamic calligraphy. It reads Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious.</p>
	<p> The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques. Dated in its present state from the 9th century, it is the ancestor and model of all the mosques in the western Islamic lands.</p>
	<p> In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, Tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming Dynasty paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century.</p>
	<p> Painting by Song dynasty artist Ma Lin, circa 1250. 24.8 × 25.2 cm</p>
	<p> The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings. This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others.</p>
	<p> The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.</p>
	<p> Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. Theodor W. Adorno said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist." Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.</p>
	<br><h4> Forms, genres, media, and styles</h4>
	<p> The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form. Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include visual design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm.</p>
	<p> In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context. Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like meaning and significance.</p>
	<p> Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".</p>
	<p> Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art.</p>
	<br><h3> Skill and craft</h3>
	<p> Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations. There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes. A common view is that the epithet "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.</p>
	<p> A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art.</p>
	<br><h4> Purpose</h4>
	<p> Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).</p>
	<br><h3> Non-motivated functions</h3>
	<p> The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.</p>
	<p> Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm. Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.</p>
	<p> "Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry." -Aristotle</p>
	<p> Experience of the mysterious. Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.</p>
	<p> "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein</p>
	<p> Expression of the imagination. Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.</p>
	<p> "Jupiter's eagle  is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken." -Immanuel Kant</p>
	<p> Ritualistic and symbolic functions. In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.</p>
	<p> "Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'." -Silva Tomaskova</p>
	<br><h3> Motivated functions</h3>
	<p> Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.</p>
	<p> Communication. Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.</p>
	<p> " artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication." -Steve Mithen</p>
	<p> Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.</p>
	<p> The Avante-Garde. Art for political change. One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the avante-garde arts.</p>
	<p> "By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life." -André Breton (Surrealism)</p>
	<p> Art as a "free zone", removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the avant-garde movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, contemporary art has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.</p>
	<p> Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.</p>
	<p> Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).</p>
	<p> Art for social causes. Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution. Trashion, using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.</p>
	<p> Art for psychological and healing purposes. Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy. The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.</p>
	<p> Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.</p>
	<p> Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females. According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.</p>
	<p> The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.</p>
	<br><h4> Public access</h4>
	<p> Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite, though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a very wide market. Cylinder seals were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the Ancient Near East. Once coins were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society. Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.</p>
	<p> Public buildings and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.</p>
	<p> Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British Royal Collection remains distinct, but large donations such as the Old Royal Library were made from it to the British Museum, established in 1753. The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.</p>
	<p> Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.</p>
	<p> Performance by Joseph Beuys, 1978: Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism</p>
	<p> There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form...  endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."</p>
	<p> In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."</p>
	<br><h4> Controversies</h4>
	<p> Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ.</p>
	<p> The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of Romanticism, and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. Édouard Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X) (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.</p>
	<p> The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.</p>
	<br><h4> Theory</h4>
	<p> Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries. This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art. The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W. Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.</p>
	<p> The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.</p>
	<br><h3> Arrival of Modernism</h3>
	<p> The arrival of Modernism in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism. Clement Greenberg's 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself". Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:</p>
	<p> Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.</p>
	<p> After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.</p>
	<p> Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.</p>
	<p> Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. The Invention of Art: A Cultural History is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but techne. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming etc.</p>
	<br><h3> New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"</h3>
	<p> Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.</p>
	<p> In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "The Intentional Fallacy", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.</p>
	<p> In another essay, "The Affective Fallacy," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).</p>
	<p> As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic." These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."</p>
	<p> Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."</p>
	<br><h3> "Linguistic turn" and its debate</h3>
	<p> The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-poststructuralism debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art. Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism. In 1981, the artist Mark Tansey created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by Hayden White. The fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Ernst Gombrich and Nelson Goodman in his book Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s. He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist Roger Sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.</p>
	<br><h4> Classification disputes</h4>
	<p> Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."</p>
	<p> Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects. One of these, Fountain (1917), an ordinary urinal, has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art. Anti-art is a feature of work by Situationist International, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the Young British Artists, though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists, who describe themselves as anti-anti-art.</p>
	<br><h3> Value judgment</h3>
	<p> Somewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist), or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.</p>
	<p> The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.</p>`

	eArt: `Bible. τὰ βίϐλία , plural of βιβλιον, book; that is to say, the writings or Book par excellence. See Scripture. This is the name that Christians give to the collection of sacred books, written through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The Bible is generally divided into two parts; to wit, the Old and the New Testaments. We call books of the Old Testament those that were written before the birth of Jesus Christ, which contain, besides the law and the history of the Jews, the predictions of prophets concerning the Messiah, and various books or treatises on morality. The New Testament contains books written after the death of Jesus Christ by his apostles or his disciples.
	<p> Following the decision of the Council of Trent, sess. 4, the books of the Old Testament are the Pentateuch, which includes the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), then come the books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the four books of the Kings, two of Paralipomenon [Chronicles], the First and the Second Esdras, those of Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job; the Psalter of David containing one hundred fifty psalms; Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, the Canticle of Canticles, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Baruch; Ezekiel, Daniel, the twelve minor Prophets, and the two books of the Maccabees: that makes a total of forty-five books.</p>
	<p> The New Testament contains twenty-seven books, which are the Four Gospels, the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, the fourteen epistles of St. Paul, the epistle of St. James, the two epistles of St. Peter, the three epistles of St. John, the epistle of St. Jude, and the Apocalypse. Such is the current canon or catalogue of Scripture accepted in the Catholic Church, but which is not admitted by all the sects or societies that have separated from it. See Canon [Canon, Canon (Theology), Canon (Ecclesiastical History)].</p>
	<p> With respect to the Old Testament, a great number of the books that it contains have been accepted as sacred and canonical by the Jews and by all the ancient Christians: but there are also some that the Jews have not recognized and which the first Christians have not always accepted as canonical, but which since have been placed by the Church within the canon of sacred Books. These last are the books of Tobit, Judith, the Book of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and the two books of the Maccabees: some people have even doubted the authenticity of the books of Baruch and Esther. All these books were written in the Hebrew language, with the exception of those that the Jews do not recognize at all. The ancient characters [alphabet] were Samaritan: but after the captivity the new Chaldean characters were used. They were translated several times into Greek; the oldest and most authentic version is that of the Septuagint, which even the apostles themselves used See Septuagint and Version.</p>
	<p> Although most of the books of the New Testament have also been accepted as canonical since the earliest times of the Church, still the authenticity of some of them has been doubted, like the epistle to the Hebrews, that of St. Jude, the second of St. Peter, the second and the third of St. John, and the Apocalypse. All the books of the New Testament were written in Greek, with the exception of the Gospel of St. Matthew and the epistle to the Hebrews, which are believed to have been originally written in Hebrew. This is the opinion of St. Jerome, against whom some modern critics have maintained that the whole New Testament was written in Syriac: but this opinion is also without proof or plausibility.</p>
	<p> Copies of the Bible have multiplied extremely, either in relation to the original texts, or in relation to the versions made of it in most dead or living languages, this division being the most suitable for giving a clear idea to the reader. Thus one distinguishes among Bibles according to the language in which they are written—into Hebraic, Greek, Latin, Chaldean, Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, Armenian, Persian, Moscovite, etc. —and those that are in common tongues: we are going to treat each in order and separately.</p>
	<p> The Hebraic Bibles are either manuscript or printed. The best manuscript Bibles are those that were copied by the Jews of Spain; those that were done by the Jews of Germany being less exact, although more numerous. It is easy to distinguish them at a glance. The former are in beautiful, regular characters, like the Hebraic Bibles of Bomberg, Etienne, and Plantin. Others in similar characters are those of Munster and Gryphe. M. Simon observes that the most ancient Hebraic Bibles are not more than 600 or 700 years old. The Rabbi Menahem, who printed some works in Venice in 1618 on the Hebraic Bibles , cites a great number of them, however, of which the antiquity (counting back from his time) already went back beyond 600 years. One finds several of these manuscript Bibles in the King's library, in that of the Jesuits of Paris, and and that of the Fathers of the Oratory of the rue Saint Honoré.</p>
	<p> The most ancient printed Hebraic Bibles are those that were published by the Jews of Italy, especially those of Pesaro and Brescia. The Jews of Portugal had begun to print some parts of the Bible in Lisbon before they were chased out of this kingdom. One notices in general that the best Hebraic Bibles are those that were printed under the eyes of the Jews themselves, so careful to observe even periods and commas that it is impossible for them to be surpassed in exactitude. At the beginning of the XVI century, Daniel Bomberg printed several Hebraic Bibles in folio and in quarto in Venice, of which a few are very esteemed by Jews and Christians. The first was printed in 1517: it bears the name of its publisher, Felix Pratenni and is the less exact. The second is from 1526; to it has been joined the periods of the Massoretes, the commentaries of various rabbis, and a Hebrew preface by Rabbi Jacob Benchahim. In 1548, the same Bomberg printed the Bible in - fol. of this latter rabbi; it is the best and the most perfect of all: it is distinguished from the first Bible of the same publisher in that it contains the commentary of Rabbi D. Kimchi on the chronicles, which is in no other. Based on this edition, [Johannes] Buxtorf the elder printed in Basel in 1618 his Bible Hébraïque des Rabbins : but he slipped in several mistakes, especially in the rabbis' commentaries, for Buxtorf altered a rather large number of their passages that were little favorable to the Christians. The same year appeared in Venice a new edition of the Rabbinic Bible of Léon of Modena, rabbi of this city, who claimed to have corrected a great number of mistakes disseminated in the first edition. But although this Bible is much inferior both in the paper and in the characters to other Bibles of Venice, it passed through the hands of the Inquisitors, who did not leave it in its entirety, with regard to the commentaries of the Rabbis.</p>
	<p> The Hebraic Bible of R. Etienne is esteemed for the beauty of the characters, but it is too unfaithful. Plantin has also printed in Anvers various very beautiful Hebraic Bibles , of which the best is that of 1566 in - 4°. Manasseh Ben Israel, a Portugese Jewish scholar, did in Amsterdam two editions of the Bible in Hebrew, one in - 4°. and the other in - 8°. The first was in two columns and thereby the most convenient for the reader. In 1634, Rabbi Jacob Lombroso published in Venice a new edition in - 4°. with small literal notes at the bottom of the pages, where Hebrew words are explained by Spanish words. This Bible is esteemed by the Jews of Constantinople. Noted in the text by a small star are the places where one should read the point camés by a camés hatouph , that is to say, by an o and not by an a. Of all the editions of Hebraïc Bibles in - 8°, the most beautiful and the most correct are those of Joseph Athias, Jew of Amsterdam; the first of 1661, preferable for its paper; the other of 1667, more faithful; but Vander Hoogt published one in 1705 that is still better than either of the former.</p>
	<p> After Athias, three Protestants who knew Hebrew endeavored to review and to make a Hebraïc Bible. These three authors were Claudius, Jablonski, and Opitius. The edition of Claudius was published in Frankfort in 1677, in - 4°. One finds at the bottom of the pages various lessons from the first editions, but the author does not seem experienced enough in the manner of accentuating, especially in the books of poetry; and in addition this edition was not supervised by him and is filled with mistakes. That of Jablonski appeared in Berlin, in - 4° in 1699. The printing was very clear, and the characters are very beautiful, but although the author claimed to have used the editions of Athias and of Claudius, several critics still found his too much resembling that of the edition in - 4°. of Bomberg as to suspect him of having followed it perhaps in overly servile fashion. That of Opitius was also printed in - 4°. in Keil in 1709, but the beauty of the paper does not match that of the characters; moreover the editor used only German manuscripts, overly neglecting those that are in France, a fault he had in common with Claudius and Jablonski. These Bibles still have this advantage, that apart from the divisions, either general or particuliar, into Paraskes and Pemkim , according to the manner of the Jews, they also have the divisions into chapters and into verses, following the method of the Christians, as well as the keri - ketib , or different ways of reading, and the summaries in Latin; which makes them very useful for Latin editions and Concordances. The small Bible in - 16° by Robert Etienne is very esteemed for the beauty of the characters: one must observe that there is another edition of it in Geneva that is comparable, except that the impression of it is poor and the text less correct. One might add to this catalogue some other Hebraïc Bibles without periods in - 8° and in - 24, very esteemed by the Jews, not because they are more exact but because the smallness of the volumes makes them more handy in their synagogues and in their schools. There are two editions of this sort, one by Plantin in - 8° in two columns, and the other in - 24, printed by Raphalengius in Leyden in 1610. One also finds an Amsterdam edition in large characters by Laurent in 1631; and another in - 12 from Frankfort in 1694 with a preface by Leusden, but it is full of mistakes.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans.</p>
	<p> Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.</p>
	<p> Attitudes towards the Bible also differ amongst Christian groups. Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the Protestant Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only source of Christian teaching.</p>
	<p> With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. It has estimated annual sales of 100 million copies, and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed using movable type.</p>
	<br><h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> The English word Bible is from the Latin biblia, from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία ta biblia "the books" (singular βιβλίον biblion).</p>
	<p> Medieval Latin biblia is short for biblia sacra "holy book", while biblia in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. bibliorum). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe. Latin biblia sacra "holy books" translates Greek τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια ta biblia ta hagia, "the holy books".</p>
	<p> The word βιβλίον itself had the literal meaning of "paper" or "scroll" and came to be used as the ordinary word for "book". It is the diminutive of βύβλος byblos, "Egyptian papyrus", possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece. The Greek ta biblia (lit. "little papyrus books") was "an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books (the Septuagint). Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE. The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer (in his Homilies on Matthew, delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia ("the books") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together.</p>
	<br><h3> Textual history</h3>
	<p> By the 2nd century BCE, Jewish groups began calling the books of the Bible the "scriptures" and they referred to them as "holy", or in Hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible "The Holy Bible" (in Greek τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια, tà biblía tà ágia) or "the Holy Scriptures" (η Αγία Γραφή, e Agía Graphḗ). The Bible was divided into chapters in the 13th century by Stephen Langton and it was divided into verses in the 16th century by French printer Robert Estienne and is now usually cited by book, chapter, and verse. The division of the Hebrew Bible into verses is based on the sof passuk cantillation mark used by the 10th-century Masoretes to record the verse divisions used in earlier oral traditions.</p>
	<p> The oldest extant copy of a complete Bible is an early 4th-century parchment book preserved in the Vatican Library, and it is known as the Codex Vaticanus. The oldest copy of the Tanakh in Hebrew and Aramaic dates from the 10th century CE. The oldest copy of a complete Latin (Vulgate) Bible is the Codex Amiatinus, dating from the 8th century.</p>
	<br><h4> Development</h4>
	<p> Professor John K. Riches, Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, says that "the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the ages", and "the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political, cultural, economic, and ecological – varied enormously". Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, says that the Old Testament is "a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing." He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by God and passed to mankind. Parallel to the solidification of the Hebrew canon (c. 3rd century BCE), only the Torah first and then the Tanakh began to be translated into Greek and expanded, now referred to as the Septuagint or the Greek Old Testament.</p>
	<p> In Christian Bibles, the New Testament Gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century CE. Riches says that:</p>
	<p> Scholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the Gospels, but the results have not been too encouraging. The period of transmission is short: less than 40 years passed between the death of Jesus and the writing of Mark's Gospel. This means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed form.</p>
	<p> The Bible was later translated into Latin and other languages. John Riches states that:</p>
	<p> The translation of the Bible into Latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between Western Latin-speaking Christianity and Eastern Christianity, which spoke Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and other languages. The Bibles of the Eastern Churches vary considerably: the Ethiopic Orthodox canon includes 81 books and contains many apocalyptic texts, such as were found at Qumran and subsequently excluded from the Jewish canon. As a general rule, one can say that the Orthodox Churches generally follow the Septuagint in including more books in their Old Testaments than are in the Jewish canon.</p>
	<p> The Nash Papyrus (2nd century BCE) contains a portion of a pre-Masoretic Text, specifically the Ten Commandments and the Shema Yisrael prayer.</p>
	<br><h4> Hebrew Bible</h4>
	<p> The Masoretic Text is the authoritative Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation.</p>
	<p> The oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE, and the Aleppo Codex (once the oldest complete copy of the Masoretic Text, but now missing its Torah section) dates from the 10th century.</p>
	<p> The name Tanakh (Hebrew: תנ"ך‎) reflects the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, Torah ("Teaching"), Nevi'im ("Prophets") and Ketuvim ("Writings").</p>
	<br><h3> Torah</h3>
	<p> The Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the "Five Books of Moses" or the Pentateuch, meaning "five scroll-cases".</p>
	<p> The Hebrew names of the books are derived from the first words in the respective texts. The Torah consists of the following five books:</p>
	<p> • Genesis, Beresheeth (בראשית)</p>
	<p> • Exodus, Shemot (שמות)</p>
	<p> • Leviticus, Vayikra (ויקרא)</p>
	<p> • Numbers, Bamidbar (במדבר)</p>
	<p> • Deuteronomy, Devarim (דברים)</p>
	<p> The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the creation (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and Jacob's children, the "Children of Israel", especially Joseph. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of Ur, eventually to settle in the land of Canaan, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of Moses, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in Ancient Egypt to the renewal of their covenant with God at Mount Sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.</p>
	<p> The Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history). These commandments provide the basis for Jewish religious law. Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (taryag mitzvot).</p>
	<br><h3> Nevi'im</h3>
	<p> Nevi'im (Hebrew: נְבִיאִים Nəḇî'îm‎‎, "Prophets") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (Nevi'im Rishonim נביאים ראשונים, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Nevi'im Aharonim נביאים אחרונים, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).</p>
	<p> The Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, ancient Israel and Judah, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in "the LORD God" and believers in foreign gods, and the criticism of unethical and unjust behaviour of Israelite elites and rulers; in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
	<br><h2> Former Prophets</h2>
	<p> The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:</p>
	<p> Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua),</p>
	<p> the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges),</p>
	<p> the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the Books of Samuel)</p>
	<p> the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (Books of Kings)</p>
	<br><h2> Latter Prophets</h2>
	<p> The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the "major" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets:</p>
	<p> • Hosea, Hoshea (הושע)</p>
	<p> • Joel, Yoel (יואל)</p>
	<p> • Amos, Amos (עמוס)</p>
	<p> • Obadiah, Ovadyah (עבדיה)</p>
	<p> • Jonah, Yonah (יונה)</p>
	<p> • Micah, Mikhah (מיכה)</p>
	<p> • Nahum, Nahum (נחום)</p>
	<p> • Habakkuk, Havakuk (חבקוק)</p>
	<p> • Zephaniah, Tsefanya (צפניה)</p>
	<p> • Haggai, Khagay (חגי)</p>
	<p> • Zechariah, Zekharyah (זכריה)</p>
	<p> • Malachi, Malakhi (מלאכי)</p>
	<br><h3> Ketuvim</h3>
	<p> Ketuvim or Kəṯûḇîm (in Biblical Hebrew: כְּתוּבִים‎‎ "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy.</p>
	<br><h2> The poetic books</h2>
	<p> In Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields Emet אמ"ת, which is also the Hebrew for "truth").</p>
	<p> These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.</p>
	<br><h2> The five scrolls (Hamesh Megillot)</h2>
	<p> The five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as "authoritative" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.</p>
	<p> Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:</p>
	<p> Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).</p>
	<p> The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.</p>
	<p> Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.</p>
	<br><h2> Order of the books</h2>
	<p> The following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.</p>
	<p> The Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)</p>
	<p> Tehillim (Psalms) תְהִלִּים</p>
	<p> Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) מִשְלֵי</p>
	<p> Iyyôbh (Book of Job) אִיּוֹב</p>
	<p> The Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)</p>
	<p> Shīr Hashshīrīm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon) שִׁיר הַשׁשִׁירִים (Passover)</p>
	<p> Rūth (Book of Ruth) רוּת (Shābhû‘ôth)</p>
	<p> Eikhah (Lamentations) איכה (Ninth of Av) </p>
	<p> Qōheleth (Ecclesiastes) קהלת (Sukkôth)</p>
	<p> Estēr (Book of Esther) אֶסְתֵר (Pûrîm)</p>
	<p> Other books</p>
	<p> Dānî’ēl (Book of Daniel) דָּנִיֵּאל</p>
	<p> ‘Ezrā (Book of Ezra–Book of Nehemiah) עזרא</p>
	<p> Divrei ha-Yamim (Chronicles) דברי הימים</p>
	<p> The Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.</p>
	<p> In Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra.</p>
	<br><h2> Canonization</h2>
	<p> The Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as biblical canon. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the Common Era.</p>
	<p> Evidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title. References in the four Gospels as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.</p>
	<p> Many scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the Council of Jamnia c. 90 CE. Against Apion, the writing of Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which "... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable..." For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny.</p>
	<br><h3> Original languages</h3>
	<p> The Tanakh was mainly written in biblical Hebrew, with some small portions (Ezra 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26, Jeremiah 10:11, Daniel 2:4–7:28) written in biblical Aramaic, a sister language which became the lingua franca for much of the Semitic world.</p>
	<br><h4> Septuagint</h4>
	<p> The Septuagint, or the LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE, initially in Alexandria, but in time it was completed elsewhere as well. It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised.</p>
	<p> As the work of translation progressed, the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the Nevi'im, had various hagiographical works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the Maccabees and the Wisdom of Sirach. However, the book of Sirach, is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Jewish canon. Some of these deuterocanonical books (e.g. the Wisdom of Solomon, and the second book of Maccabees) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.</p>
	<p> Since Late Antiquity, once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century Council of Jamnia, mainstream Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis. Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity. Finally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek – even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew).</p>
	<p> The Septuagint is the basis for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while Protestant churches usually do not. After the Protestant Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called Biblical apocrypha. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version.</p>
	<br><h3> Incorporations from Theodotion</h3>
	<p> In most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotion's translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. Jerome reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, "This thing 'just' happened." One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.</p>
	<p> The canonical Ezra–Nehemiah is known in the Septuagint as "Esdras B", and 1 Esdras is "Esdras A". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra–Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that "Esdras B" – the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and "Esdras A" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.</p>
	<br><h3> Final form</h3>
	<p> Some texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Odes, including the Prayer of Manasseh, the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.</p>
	<p> Some books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν ("Of Reigns"). In LXX, the Books of Chronicles supplement Reigns and it is called Paralipomenon (Παραλειπομένων—things left out). The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.</p>
	<br><h4> Christian Bibles</h4>
	<p> A Christian Bible is a set of books that a Christian denomination regards as divinely inspired and thus constituting scripture. Although the Early Church primarily used the Septuagint or the Targums among Aramaic speakers, the apostles did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament developed over time. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.</p>
	<p> Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Authorized King James Version, the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version, the New American Standard Version, the New King James Version, the New International Version, and the English Standard Version.</p>
	<br><h3> Old Testament</h3>
	<p> The books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see Catholic Bible), Orthodox, and Protestant (see Protestant Bible) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic Peshitta.</p>
	<br><h2> Apocryphal or deuterocanonical books</h2>
	<p> In Eastern Christianity, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into Western languages. Some modern Western translations since the 14th century make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
	<p> A number of books which are part of the Peshitta or the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 1545–1563. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.</p>
	<p> Most Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.</p>
	<p> The Anglican Church uses some of the Apocryphal books liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix.</p>
	<br><h2> Pseudepigraphal books</h2>
	<p> The term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The "Old Testament" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:</p>
	<p> Notable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, surviving only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew, c. 5th to 6th century CE). These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah. They are not part of the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired. However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.</p>
	<p> The older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BC, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BCE.</p>
	<br><h2> Denominational views of Pseudepigrapha</h2>
	<p> There arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term pseudepigrapha for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called deuterocanonical and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term pseudepigraphical, as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some Jewish sects. Many works that are "apocryphal" are otherwise considered genuine.</p>
	<br><h2> Role of the Old Testament in Christian theology</h2>
	<p> The Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says "Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures." He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the "holy writings" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the "new covenant" prophesied by Jeremiah.</p>
	<br><h3> New Testament</h3>
	<p> The term "New Testament" came into use in the second century during a controversy among Christians over whether or not the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament. Some other works which were widely read by early churches were excluded from the New Testament and relegated to the collections known as the Apostolic Fathers (generally considered orthodox) and the New Testament Apocrypha (including both orthodox and heretical works). Most Christians consider the New Testament to be an infallible source of doctrine, while others go even farther to affirm that it is also inerrant, or completely correct in historical and factual details as well as theologically. In recent times, however, the authority of the New Testament books has been challenged. The school of historical criticism has exposed various apparent contradictions within the texts, as well as questions of authorship and dating.</p>
	<p> The New Testament is a collection of 27 books of 4 different genres of Christian literature (Gospels, one account of the Acts of the Apostles, Epistles and an Apocalypse). These books can be grouped into:</p>
	<p> The Gospels</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Synoptic Gospels.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Gospel According to Matthew.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Gospel According to Mark.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Gospel According to Luke.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Gospel According to John.</p>
	<p> Narrative literature, account and history of the Apostolic age.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Acts of the Apostles.</p>
	<p> Pauline Epistles.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Romans.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• First Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Second Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Galatians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Philippians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Colossians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• First Epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Second Epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
	<p> Pastoral epistles.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• First Epistle to Timothy.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Second Epistle to Timothy.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to Titus.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to Philemon.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
	<p> General epistles, also called catholic epistles.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle of James.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• First Epistle of Peter.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Second Epistle of Peter.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• First Epistle of John.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Second Epistle of John.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Third Epistle of John.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Epistle of Jude.</p>
	<p> Apocalyptic literature, also called Prophetical.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;• Revelation, or the Apocalypse.</p>
	<p> The New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant tradition, the Slavonic tradition, the Syriac tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.</p>
	<br><h2> Original language</h2>
	<p> The mainstream consensus is that the New Testament was written in a form of Koine Greek, which was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600).</p>
	<br><h2> Historic editions</h2>
	<p> See also: Biblical manuscript and Textual criticism</p>
	<p> An early German translation by Martin Luther. His translation of the text into the vernacular was highly influential.</p>
	<p> The original autographs, that is, the original Greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived. But historically copies exist of those original autographs, transmitted and preserved in a number of manuscript traditions. There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page (marginal glosses) to correct their text—especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line—and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions.</p>
	<p> The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.</p>
	<br><h3> Development of the Christian canons</h3>
	<p> The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in 393 CE. Also c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.</p>
	<p> The Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon—the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division—while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon. The term "Hebrew Scriptures" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.</p>
	<p> The New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in 2 Timothy 3:16, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God".</p>
	<br><h2> Ethiopian Orthodox canon</h2>
	<p> The Canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches. There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to Enoch and Jubilees which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament, also Greek Ezra First and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.</p>
	<br><h4> Divine inspiration</h4>
	<p> The Second Epistle to Timothy says that "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness". (2 Timothy 3:16) Various related but distinguishable views on divine inspiration include:</p>
	<p> • The view of the Bible as the inspired word of God: the belief that God, through the Holy Spirit, intervened and influenced the words, message, and collation of the Bible</p>
	<p> • The view that the Bible is also infallible, and incapable of error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in historic or scientific matters</p>
	<p> • The view that the Bible represents the inerrant word of God, without error in any aspect, spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans</p>
	<p> Within these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate. "Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture." Fundamentalist Christians are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader.</p>
	<p> Jewish antiquity attests to belief in sacred texts, and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention divine agency in relation to its writings. In their book A General Introduction to the Bible, Norman Geisler and William Nix write: "The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record." Most evangelical biblical scholars associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy which asserted that inspiration applied only to the autographic text of Scripture. Among adherents of Biblical literalism, a minority, such as followers of the King-James-Only Movement, extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular translation.</p>
	<br><h4> Versions and translations</h4>
	<p> The original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the Targum Onkelos, an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.</p>
	<p> The primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.</p>
	<p> The earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or Vetus Latina, which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.</p>
	<p> According to the Latin Decretum Gelasianum (also known as the Gelasian Decree), thought to be of a 6th-century document of uncertain authorship and of pseudepigraphal papal authority (variously ascribed to Pope Gelasius I, Pope Damasus I, or Pope Hormisdas) but reflecting the views of the Roman Church by that period, the Council of Rome in 382 AD under Pope Damasus I (366-383) assembled a list of books of the Bible. Damasus commissioned Saint Jerome to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the Latin Vulgate Bible, in the fourth century AD (although Jerome expressed in his prologues to most deuterocanonical books that they were non-canonical). And in 1546, at the Council of Trent, Jerome's Vulgate translation was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the Latin Church.</p>
	<p> Since the Protestant Reformation, Bible translations for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organizations such as Wycliffe Bible Translators, New Tribes Mission and Bible societies.</p>
	<br><h4> Views</h4>
	<p> John Riches, professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the Bible:</p>
	<p> It has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty.... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.</p>
	<br><h3> Other religions</h3>
	<p> In Islam, the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding revelation from God; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: tahrif); which necessitated the giving of the Qur'an to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, to correct this deviation.</p>
	<p> Members of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, Rastafaris view the Bible as essential to their religion and Unitarian Universalists view it as "one of many important religious texts".</p>
	<br><h3> Biblical studies</h3>
	<p> Biblical criticism refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have translation errors.</p>
	<br><h3> Higher criticism</h3>
	<p> In the 17th century Thomas Hobbes collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher Baruch Spinoza published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was "clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses."</p>
	<br><h4> Archaeological and historical research</h4>
	<p> Biblical archaeology is the archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the "New Testament"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes biblical maximalism which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible to be a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE Babylonian captivity have a basis in history.</p>
	<p> The historicity of the biblical account of the history of ancient Israel and Judah of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the United Monarchy (10th century BCE) and the historicity of David is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the Tel Dan Stele, can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the Exodus from Egypt in the Torah, and the migration to the Promised Land and the period of Judges are not considered historical in scholarship.</p>
	<br><h4> Illustrations</h4>
	<p> Most old Bibles were illuminated, they were manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations. Up to the twelfth century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where "separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk." By the fourteenth century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium started to employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators. These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day.</p>
	<p> The manuscript was "sent to the rubricator, who added (in red or other colours) the titles, headlines, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator." In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would "undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe's agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation."</p>`

	eArt: `Canada or New France, extremely vast region of North America, bordered on the east by the Ocean, on the West by the Mississippi, to the South by the English colonies, and to the north by the desolate and unknown regions. This region is inhabited by several savage nations, who survive only by hunting and fishing. Aside from these nations, the French have considerable settlements there, and have created a successful commerce in fur-pelts, which the savages bring in large quantity as a result of their hunting. Canada is full of forests, and it is extremely cold there. The savages who inhabit this country worship the sun and a Great Spirit; they regard the latter as superior to the former. The capital of Canada is Québec. See Canadians.Canadians, philosophy of the.
	<h3> Philosophy of the Canadians</h3>
	<p> We owe our knowledge of the savages of Canada to Baron de la Hontan who lived among them for about ten years. In his account he reports some conversations concerning religion which he had with one of these savages. It appears that the baron did not always come off best in the argument. What is surprising is to see a Huron misuse the weapons of our dialectic with sufficient subtlety to battle with the Christian religion. Abstractions and scholastic vocabulary are almost as familiar to him as to a European who had meditated on the books of Duns Scotus. This has led to the suspicion that Baron de la Hontan wanted to cover with ridicule the religion in which he had been brought up, and that he placed in the mouth of a savage arguments he did not dare advance himself.</p>
	<p> Most of those who have neither seen nor heard about savages have imagined them covered with hair, living unsociably in the woods like animals, and having only a partial likeness to human beings. It even seems that most men still have this conception. Yet with the exception of the hair on their head and their eyebrows—which many carefully pull out—the savages have no hair on their body. If perchance some should grow they would tear it out by the roots. They are born white like us but become tanned because they are naked, grease themselves with oils, and paint themselves with various colors which over the years the sun burns into their skin. They are tall, taller than we, have very regular features with aquiline noses, and in general are well proportioned. Rarely is one seen who limps, is one-eyed, hunchbacked, blind, etc.</p>
	<p> The first impression made by these savages is necessarily unfavorable because their eyes look fierce, their behavior is uncouth, and their manner of address so simple and reserved that a European who does not know them would find it difficult to believe that this behavior represents a kind of politeness after their fashion, a politeness whose conventions they keep among themselves as strictly as we keep ours, which they find quite ridiculous. They are not particularly outgoing and scarcely show their feelings, yet they are kind and affable, and toward foreigners and unfortunates they practice a charitable hospitality that puts all the nations of Europe to shame. They have a rather lively imagination, they exercise good judgment in dealing with their own affairs and pursue their goals with self-assurance. They are self-possessed in their actions and show a calm that would wear out our patience. Their sense of honor and their greatness of soul rarely allow them to get angry. They are high-minded and proud, their courage is unshakable, their valor intrepid, their steadfastness under pain seems to go beyond heroism, and they have a steadiness of soul that neither adversity nor good fortune can disturb.</p>
	<p> All these fine qualities would be only too worthy of our admiration if they were not accompanied by many faults. They are fickle and unreliable, indescribably lazy, exceedingly lacking in gratitude, mistrustful, treacherous, vindictive, and all the more dangerous because they know so well how to hide their resentment and can harbor it for such a long time. They practice such unheard-of cruelties on their enemies that their inventiveness in torture exceeds the greatest cruelties related in the histories of the tyrants of old. They are brutish in their pleasures, they are vicious because of both ignorance and malice, yet their primitive way of life and their extreme poverty give them one advantage over us: they are quite ignorant of the refinements of vice, which luxury and affluence have introduced among us. Now we shall turn to the essentials of their philosophy and their religion.</p>
	<p> 1. All savages maintain there is a God. They prove His existence by the composition of the universe, which makes manifest the all-powerfulness of its creator. Thus it follows, they say, that man was not made by chance but is the work of a principle which is superior in wisdom and knowledge and which they call the Great Spirit. This Great Spirit contains everything, it appears in everything, it acts in everything, and it moves all things. All that we see and conceive is this God. He exists without bounds, limits, or body and must not be represented as an old man or as any other thing, however beautiful and vast it may be. Hence the savages adore Him in everything that appears in the world. So true is this that whenever they see something that is beautiful, strange, and surprising, especially the sun and the other stars, they exclaim, "Oh Great Spirit, we see you everywhere!"</p>
	<p> 2. They say that the soul is immortal, for if it were not, all men would be equally happy in this life. Since God is infinitely perfect and infinitely wise He could not have created some men to be happy and others to be unhappy. They maintain, therefore, that God, in a way that our reason cannot understand, wants a certain number of His creatures to suffer in this world in order that He may recompense them for it in the next. Hence they cannot accept the fact that Christians call a man unfortunate for having been killed, burned, etc.; and they maintain that what we call misfortune is a misfortune only in our way of thinking, since everything happens according to the will of that infinitely perfect being whose actions are neither whimsical nor arbitrary. These ideas are not so savage.</p>
	<p> 3. The Great Spirit has endowed men with reason to enable them to distinguish good from evil and to follow the rules of justice and wisdom.</p>
	<p> 4. Tranquillity of the soul is infinitely pleasing to this Great Spirit, while on the other hand He detests the tumult of the passions that renders men wicked.</p>
	<p> 5. Life is a dream and death an awakening by which we gain understanding of the visible and the invisible.</p>
	<p> 6. Because man's reason cannot rise high enough to gain knowledge of the supraterrestrial, it is useless and even harmful to attempt to discover the invisible.</p>
	<p> 7. After our death our souls go to a certain place. We cannot tell whether the good are happy there and the wicked suffer, because we do not know whether the Great Spirit conceives happiness and suffering as we do.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Canada (Listeni/ˈkænədə/;) is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest binational land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. One third of the population lives in the three largest cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Its capital is Ottawa, and other major urban areas include Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.</p>
	<p> Various aboriginal peoples had inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French claims were made on the area, with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1535 during Jacques Cartier's second voyage to New France. As a consequence of various conflicts, Great Britain gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada.</p>
	<p> In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, but at the time, Canada decided to allow the British Parliament to temporarily retain the power to amend Canada's constitution, on request from the Parliament of Canada. With the Constitution Act 1982, Canada took over that authority (as the conclusion of Patriation), removing the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom, giving the country full sovereignty.</p>
	<p> Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.</p>
	<p> Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement". In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the St Lawrence River as Canada.</p>
	<p> From the 16th to the early 18th century "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841. Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title. The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the name of national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day. The term Dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion.</p>

	<h4> History</h4>
	<h3> Indigenous peoples</h3>
	<p> Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers. The term "Aboriginal" as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents, including the Constitution Act 1982.</p>
	<p> The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.</p>
	<p> The Aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of contact with European diseases, Canada's Aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival.</p>
	<p> Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. The Crown and Aboriginal peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though, the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Canadian government.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> European colonization</h3>
	<p> The first known attempt at European colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England. Then Basque and Portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I. In general the settlements appear to have been short-lived, possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time.</p>
	<p> In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English colony. French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.</p>
	<p> The English established additional colonies in Cupids and Ferryland, Newfoundland, beginning in 1610. The Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after. A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War. Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and the 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded Canada and most of New France to Britain after the Seven Years' War.</p>
	<p> The Royal Proclamation of 1763 created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there. This angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the 1775 outbreak of the American Revolution.</p>
	<p> The 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized American independence and ceded the newly added territories south (but not north) of the Great Lakes to the new United States. New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes. To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in Quebec, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.</p>
	<p> The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration now resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain 1815–50. New arrivals included Irish refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 per cent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.</p>
	<p> The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Confederation and expansion</h3>
	<p> Following several constitutional conferences, the 1867 Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.</p>
	<p> The Canadian parliament passed a bill introduced by the Conservative Cabinet that established a National Policy of tariffs to protect the nascent Canadian manufacturing industries. To open the West, parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory. In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, parliament created the Yukon Territory. The Cabinet of Liberal Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier fostered continental European immigrants settling the prairies and Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Early 20th century</h3>
	<p> Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the Confederation Act, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I. Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war. Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party. In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence.</p>
	<p> The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939 by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.</p>
	<p> The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany. The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Contemporary era</h3>
	<p> The financial crisis of the great depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor. After two bitter referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.</p>
	<p> Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the current Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.</p>
	<p> Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country, with the Queen's role as monarch of Canada separate from her role as the British monarch or the monarch of any of the other Commonwealth realms. In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.</p>
	<p> At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a modern secular nationalist movement. The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West. A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.</p>
	<p> In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history; the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; and the Oka Crisis of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Aboriginal groups. Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p> Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001, but declined to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In 2009, Canada's economy suffered in the worldwide Great Recession, but it has since largely rebounded. In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan civil war, and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Geography and climate</h4>
	<p> Canada occupies much of the continent of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.</p>
	<p> Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.5°N – which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole. Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost. Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi); additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).</p>
	<p> Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield. Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes (563 greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)), more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water. There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Mountains.</p>
	<p> Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River. Canada's population density, at 3.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (8.5/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world. The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor, situated in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.</p>
	<p> Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills. In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Government and politics</h4>
	<p> Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at present David Johnston), carries out most of the federal royal duties in Canada.</p>
	<p> The direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.</p>
	<p> Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either on the advice of the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act currently limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada. The list of historical parties with elected representation is substantial.</p>
	<p> Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.</p>
	<p> The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country. In addition, the Minister of Finance and Minister of Industry utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development. The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes. The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Law</h4>
	<p> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to the UK, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding clause allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.</p>
	<p> The Indian Act, various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples. Most notably, a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between Aboriginals in Canada and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. The role of the treaties and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, such as health care, and exemption from taxation. The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.</p>
	<p> Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief Justice). Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with nongovernmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.</p>
	<p> Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where civil law predominates. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. However, in most rural areas and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Foreign relations and military</h3>
	<p> Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.</p>
	<p> Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs. Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976. Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).</p>
	<p> Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba since, and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.</p>
	<p> Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.</p>
	<p> During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.</p>
	<p> In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them. In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.</p>
	<p> Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military force of 92,000 active personnel and approximately 51,000 reserve personnel. The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force. In 2013, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately C$19 billion, or around 1% of the country's GDP.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Provinces and territories</h3>
	<p> Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Economy</h4>
	<p> Canada is the world's eleventh-largest economy as of 2015, with a nominal GDP of approximately US$1.79 trillion. It is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Group of Eight (G8), and is one of the world's top ten trading nations, with a highly globalized economy. Canada is a mixed economy, ranking above the US and most western European nations on the Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom, and experiencing a relatively low level of income disparity. The country's average household disposable income per capita is over US$23,900, higher than the OECD average. Furthermore, the Toronto Stock Exchange is the seventh largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion as of 2015.</p>
	<p> In 2014, Canada's exports totalled over C$528 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $524 billion, of which approximately $351 billion originated from the United States, $49 billion from the European Union, and $35 billion from China. The country's 2014 trade surplus totalled C$5.1 billion, compared with a C$46.9 billion surplus in 2008.</p>
	<p> Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.</p>
	<p> Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.</p>
	<p> Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994. In the mid-1990s, Jean Chrétien's Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt.</p>
	<p> The global financial crisis of 2008 caused a major recession, which led to a significant rise in unemployment in Canada. By October 2009, Canada's national unemployment rate had reached 8.6 percent, with provincial unemployment rates varying from a low of 5.8 percent in Manitoba to a high of 17 percent in Newfoundland and Labrador. Between October 2008 and October 2010, the Canadian labour market lost 162,000 full-time jobs and a total of 224,000 permanent jobs. Canada's federal debt was estimated to total $566.7 billion for the fiscal year 2010–11, up from $463.7 billion in 2008–09. In addition, Canada's net foreign debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, Canada's regulated banking sector (comparatively conservative among G8 nations), the federal government's pre-crisis budgetary surpluses, and its long-term policies of lowering the national debt, resulted in a less severe recession compared to other G8 nations. As of 2015, the Canadian economy has largely stabilized and has seen a modest return to growth, although the country remains troubled by volatile oil prices, sensitivity to the Eurozone crisis and higher-than-normal unemployment rates. The federal government and many Canadian industries have also started to expand trade with emerging Asian markets, in an attempt to diversify exports; Asia is now Canada's second-largest export market after the United States. Widely debated oil pipeline proposals, in particular, are hoped to increase exports of Canadian oil reserves to China.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Science and technology</h3>
	<p> In 2012, Canada spent approximately C$31.3 billion on domestic research and development, of which around $7 billion was provided by the federal and provincial governments. As of 2015, the country has produced thirteen Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine, and was ranked fourth worldwide for scientific research quality in a major 2012 survey of international scientists. It is furthermore home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms. Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total 2014 population.</p>
	<p> The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing rockets and satellites. Canada was the third country to launch a satellite into space after the USSR and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. In 1984, Marc Garneau became Canada's first male astronaut. Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST. Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Demographics</h4>
	<p> The 2016 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure. Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7 million people with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth. The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent family reunification. The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2010, a record 280,636 people immigrated to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in 2016, a similar number of immigrants as in recent years. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.</p>
	<p> About four-fifths of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the contiguous United States border. Approximately 50 percent of Canadians live in urban areas concentrated along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, with an additional 30 percent living along the British Columbia Lower Mainland, and the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor in Alberta. Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north, and approximately 95% of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north. In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years; by 2011, it had risen to approximately 39.9 years. As of 2013, the average life expectancy for Canadians is 81 years. The majority of Canadians (69.9%) live in family households, 26.8% report living alone, and those living with unrelated persons reported at 3.7%. The average size of a household in 2006 was 2.5 people.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Education</h3>
	<p> According to a 2012 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world; the country ranks first worldwide in the number of adults having tertiary education, with 51 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree. Canada spends about 5.3% of its GDP on education. The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than 20 000 USD per student). As of 2014, 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.</p>
	<p> Since the adoption of section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, education in both English and French has been available in most places across Canada. Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education provision. The mandatory school age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent. In 2002, 43 percent of Canadians aged 25 to 64 possessed a post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34, the rate of post-secondary education reached 51 percent. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates that Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ethnicity</h3>
	<p> According to the 2006 census, the country's largest self-reported ethnic origin is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing a total of 1,172,790 people. Canada's Aboriginal population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed Aboriginal identity in 2006. Another 16.2 percent of the population belonged to a non-Aboriginal visible minority. In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Religion</h3>
	<p> Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Languages</h3>
	<p> A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. Nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Canada's federal government practices official bilingualism, which is applied by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Federal Official Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.</p>
	<p> The 1977 Charter of the French Language established French as the official language of Quebec. Although more than 85 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population. There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island.</p>
	<p> Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. There are 11 Aboriginal language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Of these, only the Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term. Several Aboriginal languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.</p>
	<p> Additionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, two of which are Indigenous. American Sign Language (ASL), is spoken across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools. Quebec Sign Language (LSQ), is spoken primarily in Quebec, however there are sizeable population centres in francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba; due to its historical relation to the francophone culture. Plains Sign Talk was the most widespread language in North America prior to colonization, spoken across the Prairies by a number of First Nations. Inuit Uukturausingit is used by Inuit in Nunavut. Maritime Sign Language was used in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island before ASL became available in the mid-20th century.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Culture</h4>
	<p> Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a "just society" are constitutionally protected. Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all its people. Multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many commentators speak of a culture of Quebec that is distinct from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic—a collection of several regional, Aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.</p>
	<p> Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
	<p> Historically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Aboriginal cultures and traditions. Through their language, art and music, Aboriginal peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity. During the 20th century Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian Identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Many Canadian comedians have archived international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.</p>
	<p> Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Symbols</h3>
	<p> Canada's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Aboriginal sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Literature</h3>
	<p> Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Visual arts</h3>
	<p> Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Music</h3>
	<p> The Canadian music industry is the sixth largest in the world producing internationally renowned composers, musicians and ensembles. Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC. The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in 1970. The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest, The Bold Canadian, was written in 1812. The national anthem of Canada, "O Canada", was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony, and was officially adopted in 1980. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French, before it was translated to English in 1906.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Sport</h3>
	<p> The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s. Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse. Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States. Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, located in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa, and Winnipeg, as well as three Major League Soccer teams (Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal) and one Toronto team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional sports in Canada include Canadian football, which is played in the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League lacrosse, and curling.</p>
	<p> Canada has participated in almost every Olympic Games since its Olympic debut in 1900, and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, the 1994 Basketball World Championship, the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Golf, tennis, skiing, badminton, volleyball, cycling, swimming, bowling, rugby union, canoeing, equestrian, squash and the study of martial arts are widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.</p>`

	eArt: `Chemistry, Encyclopedic order. Understanding. Reason. Philosophy or Science. Natural Science. Physics. General Physics. Particular Physics, or the physics of large and small bodies; Physics of small bodies or Chemistry . Chemistry is little cultivated among us; this science is not widespread, not even among scientists, in spite of the claim of universal knowledge which is so dominant today. Chemists make up a very distinct group of people, not very numerous, having their own language, laws and mysteries, and living very isolated amongst a large population which shows very little interest in their activities and expects almost nothing to come from their work. This lack of curiosity, whether real or mock, in any case has little to do with philosophy since it is founded primarily on chance judgments. It is at the very least easy to be mistaken when one makes pronouncements on subjects that one knows but superficially. Indeed, since people have surely been mistaken and even come up with more than one hasty judgment on the nature and the extent of chemical knowledge, it will not be an easy or lightly considered task to determine precisely and incontrovertibly what Chemistry really is.
	<p> First of all, those people with the least education cannot distinguish between chemists and glass-blowers; both of these words ring false to their ears. Because people have been more afraid of ridicule than of error, such prejudice has impeded progress, or at least the spread of the art, more than more serious imputations aimed at the science's very heart.</p>
	<p> For many uneducated people, being a chemist means having a laboratory, making perfumes, phosphorescent materials, colors and enamels, and being familiar with most chemical processes and some strange and more secret techniques. Or simply put, a chemist is a technician who is familiar with secret processes.</p>
	<p> Others, fewer in number, limit the idea of chemistry to its pharmaceutical side. These people always ask after each operation what cure it might offer. All they know about Chemistry are the remedies proposed by practical Medecine, or at best the hypotheses that Chemistry has furnished schools of theoretical medecine.</p>
	<p> The following criticism is also frequently heard: the principles of matter assigned by Chemists deal with compounds; the products of their analysis are created by fire; fire, the primary agent of Chemists, alters materials it is applied to and confuses the basic principles of their composition, ignis mutat res. These criticisms are based on the misconceptions I've just described, although they do seem to reflect a knowledge of chemical doctrines and facts.</p>
	<p> It seems safe to say that books written by Chemists, masters of the art, are totally ignored. How many physicists ever mention Becher or Stahl? Chemical studies (or rather books about chemical subjects) written by scientists who are famous for other reasons are much more widely known. That's the case, for example, of Jean Bernouilli's treatise on fermentation and the famous Boerhaave’s scholarly compilation about fire. Such works are known, quoted and praised, whereas the higher ideas and unique details that Stahl has published in both areas are recognized by only a few chemists.</p>
	<p> Some chemistry can be found in the works of the true physicists, for indeed many of them deal with chemistry, including views on general systems and fundamental doctrinal principles. This kind of chemistry, however, and it is the most widely known, has the great disadvantage of not having been sufficiently discussed or verified in every detail and measured againsts facts. What Boyle, Newton, Keill, Freind, Boerhaave, etc. have written is marked by lack of experimentation. So we can't expect to get a true picture of Chemistry by studying such people.</p>
	<p> One might expect to get a valid picture from the ancients. They are rich in facts and in true chemical knowledge. They are indeed Chemists, but their obscurantism is truly frightening and their enthusiasm is disconcerting for the wise and staid demeanor of sensory philosophy. And it is quite difficult to see true Chemistry in the sacred and divine art and in Nature's rival and corrector as seen by the first fathers of the science.</p>
	<p> Since Chemistry has taken on the form of true science, that is, since it has accepted the prevalent physical systems, since it has become successively Cartesian, corpuscular, Newtonian, academic or experimental, varius chemists have proposed neater models, models more in line with ordinary scientific logic. They've borrowed the tone of prior ideas. But perhaps that's a reason for criticism. Should they not have more carefully preserved their independence? Didn’t they have a special right to claim their independence, given the nature of their study? Are Chemists’ temerity (some say folly) and enthusiasm really any different from the creative genius of a systematic spirit? And should we banish this systematic spirit on the grounds that it’s premature development produced errors in less happy times? Simply because their ambition led them to make mistakes, must we conclude that the desire to improve is a mistake? Would it have been better if the world of genius brought back to general awareness by certain great courageous men of our time had came back through revolution?</p>
	<p> In any case, the modern style, including attention to detail and the slow, timid, and circumspect advance of the physcial sciences has dominated absolutely in our basic texts and our bodies of doctrine. These books are nothing more (or at least their authors don't claim they are anything more) than well-organized collections of facts that have been chosen carefully and strictly verified, of clear, wise and sometimes new explanations, and of useful corrections to certain processes. Each section of such books may be perfect, or at least exact. But what is missing is the nexus, the whole, the system, and especially what I might call the path which Chemistry might take to incorporate new objects of study, to enlighten other sciences, in short, to grow.</p>
	<p> It's primarily because of the mediocre nature of such treatises that people see Chemists in a false light as simply technicians or experimenters. And that's also why people never suspect that there might exist a Chemistry that is truly philosophical, reasoned, deep and transcendent. Or that there might be chemists who dare look beyond the senses, who aspire to a higher order, and who, though remaining within the confines of their art, are able to envision elements of the nature of the world.</p>
	<p> Boerhaave made it clear at the beginning of his Chemistry that chemical objects can be sensed, can take up space and can be held in containers, corpora sensibus patula, vel patefacienda, vasis coercenda, etc. The first historian of the Royal Academy of Sciences, when asked to compare the way two famous scientists approach philosophy, one of them being a chemist and the other a physicist, gave the following distinction: "Chemistry, using certain visible operations, reduces bodies to specific palpable form, such as salt, sulfurs, etc., but Physics, by delicate speculation, acts on principles the way Chemistry does on bodies, and reduces them to other simpler principles, into smaller bodies, propulsed and formed in infinite ways. And that's the primary difference between Physics and Chemistry. The spirit of Chemistry is more complicated, more hidden. It is more related to compound substances, whose principles are intermingled. The spirit of Physics is cleaner, neater and less encumbered. It goes back all the way to the origins, whereas Chemistry doesn't go so far." Mém. De l’acad. Des Sciences, 1699.</p>
	<p> Chemists wouldn't be very strongly tempted to claim for themselves some of the prerogatives on which Physics is said to be superior, for example, the "delicate speculations" by which it reduces chemical principles into little bodies “propulsed and formed in infinite ways.” But they would not agree with the comment that the spirit of chemistry is more complicated, more hidden, and not as neat and simple as the spirit of physics. And they would agree even less that Physics goes beyond Chemistry. They would claim on the contrary that Chemistry can penetrate certain bodies about which Physics knows only the surface and the outside shape; quam & boves & asini discernunt , said Becher bluntly in his physiq. soûterr. And they don't believe they would be proposing a foolhardy paradox if they were to say, concerning most of the questions raised by the phrase “it goes all the way back to the origins,” that Physics has thus far only confused abstract notions with the truths of existence, and consequently it has not understood for example the nature of the composition of compounds, or the nature of matter, its divisibility. It has failed to understand claims about matter’s homogeneity, the porosity of bodies, the essence of solidity, of liquidity, of softness, of elasticity, claims about the nature of fire, of colors, of odors, the theory of evaporation, etc. Such chemists, rebellious enough not to recognize the sovereignty of Physics, would claim that Chemistry has the capacity to explain such things a great deal better, though one must admit that so far it hasn’t clearly done so and that it has failed to point out its natural advantages. And indeed, we must admit that there are even some chemists so unaware that their art can be raised to such levels that if they happen across such statements, either in books or from the mouths of some of their fellow chemists, they would be quick to look down their noses and say “that must be physics.” By that judgement all they do is show how little they understand either Physics, to which they attribute what doesn’t belong there, or Chemistry, which they deprive of what is rightly Chemistry’s alone.</p>
	<p> Whatever our claims might be, the idea that Physicists had of themselves and of Chemists in 1669 is precisely what the most illustrious of them still have. Their opinion deprives us of support which we would proudly accept and does real harm to Chemistry, irreparable harm. For they discourage young vigorous minds from undertaking the study of Chemistry. Such minds could never allow themselves to be dragged from procedure to procedure nor content themselves with meager, dry, weak and isolated explanations. But they could have become zealous chemists if someone would have shown them how much Chemistry could offer to eager minds and how much they could in turn contribute to Chemistry.</p>
	<p> It is surely very difficult to destroy such misconceptions. A revolution that would give Chemistry the rank it deserves, that would put it at least at the same rank as mathematical Physics, can be accomplished only by a courageous and enthusiastic chemist. Such a person, occupying a respected position and knowing how to use favorable circumstances to his advantage, might be able to get the attention of scientists, first by a captivating presentation and a firm positive tone, followed by the real reasons after initial prejudice against Chemistry has weakened.</p>
	<p> But, while we're waiting for some new Paracelsus to make the claim that all the mistakes that have deformed Physics come from the same source, and that is that people didn't know their Chemistry and gave themselves airs, thinking they could philosophize and explain the natural world, whereas Chemistry, being the basis of Physics, is the only science that can do so, etc., already some like Jean Keill have said as much in terms of Geometry, as has Mr. Desaguliers in the preface to his course in experimental Physics. But while we’re waiting, as I said, we will nonetheless attempt to present Chemistry in such light as it may be recognized worthy by Philosophers. And perhaps we can suggest how they might find it useful.</p>
	<p> Our present goal is to convince such people, although we realize that we can't raise Chemistry to the level it deserves by showing them its philosophical side, that we can't do for Chemistry what elegant machines, optics and electricity have done for Physics. But since there are able chemists who already have public esteem, and since they themselves can present Chemistry in a way most apt to propogate it, we have decided to lean on their zeal and their talents.</p>
	<p> But, in order to present general philosphical Chemistry in the way that I understand it (and I say "present" or “announce” without going further), and in order to indicate sufficiently its method, its doctrine and its scope of activity, and especially its relationship with other sciences, by which I would like to begin, we must go back to some basic considerations about the scope of these branches of science.</p>
	<p> Physics, understood broadly to be the science of bodies and their movements, can be divided first of all into two distinct primitive branches. The first branch studies bodies by examining their exterior qualities, by considering physical objects as simply existing and having qualities that can be captured by the senses. The sciences included in this division are the different parts of Cosmography and pure Natural History.</p>
	<p> The causes of the existence of such objects, their qualities that can be captured by the senses, their internal properties or forces, the changes they might undergo, as well as the changes, laws, order or succession of such changes, those are the areas studied by the second primitive branch of Physics.</p>
	<p> But nature can also be considered either as acting in the ordinary course of events by constant natural laws or as being constrained to act by human art. For men have learned how to imitate, direct, vary, speed up, slow down, suppress, complete, etc. various natural operations, thus producing certain effects, which though they may be natural, cannot be seen as happening due to agents acting simply in accordance with general laws of the universe. Therefore we find a well-founded division of the second branch of Physics into two parts. The first part studies changes introduced by non-intelligent agents, and the second, those dealing with human operations and experiments, that is knowledge furnished by practical physical sciences, and specifically by experimental Physics and by different physical arts. Chemists ordinarily designate this double theater of their speculations by the names the laboratory of nature and the laboratory of art .</p>
	<p> All changes operative in bodies, either by nature or by art, can be reduced to three categories. The first includes those that permit bodies to move from a nonorganic to an organic state, and vice versa, as well as all those that depend upon or constitute organic systems. The second includes those changes that belong to the union or separation of constituant parts of compounds or of materials making up nonorganic compounds, all the phenomena of combination and decomposition used by modern chemists. The third category, finally, includes all those changes that push masses and compound bodies from rest to movement, or from movement to rest, or which modify different kinds of motion and tendancies.</p>
	<p> One assertion, evidence for which we can find in Mr. De Buffon's discoveries, is that organic molecules and organisms obey laws that are essentially different from those that govern the motion of matter that can be put at rest or is inert. Errors made by doctors who have tried to explain animal organisms by the laws of mechanics tell us the same thing. Consequently, phenomena of organisms must be the object of a science that is essentially different from the other parts of Physics. That consequence cannot be contested.</p>
	<p> If it is true that the principles governing the composition of bodies are different from those concerning compounds or masses, the usefulness of the above distinction will be fully demonstrated. That indeed is what Chemists claim, and our goal is to explain and expand their doctrine in that regard. We must admit that their doctrine is not clear, precise or profond, not even among those authors of Chemistry whose style tends toward philosophy and who appear to be the most interested in such questions. Indeed, Stahl himself, who epitomizes the dual character we've just described, has not sufficiently developed his thoughts on such differences. Nor has he pushed them far enough or considered them fully from his own point of view. See his Prodromus de investigatione Chimico—physiologica , and his observation de differentia mixti, texti, aggregati, individui .</p>
	<p> I shall call mass or aggregate bodies any uniformly dense assemblage of continuous parts, parts that are linked by a force which resists their dispersion.</p>
	<p> This relational force, whatever its cause might be, I shall call a relationship of mass.</p>
	<p> The continuity essential for such an aggregate doesn't necessarily mean that all parts are contiguous. That is, it is possible for this relationship of mass to exist among parts that are not in contact, whatever material provides the linkage, or even if this linkage is non-material.</p>
	<p> The relationship of mass supposes homogeneity in the aggregrate. For an assemblage of heterogeneous parts does not constitute a whole whose parts are linked by that relationship. Thus, a cloudy liquid or a chunk of clay filled with pebbles, when considered as a whole, are not aggregates, but simple confused mixtures, which we claim are different from aggregates.</p>
	<p> According to this definition, it is evident that heaps or collections of simply contiguous parts, such as powders, are not aggregates, but they can be collections of aggregates.</p>
	<p> And, if we are still considering organisms, it is also clear by the same definition that they are totally excluded from the class of aggregates.</p>
	<p> Modern Physicists call the parts of an aggregate molecules or masses of the final compostion (or the final order), or derived compounds. Earlier Physicists more properly called them intergral parts or simply corpuscles . I say more properly, for it is gratuitous, to say the least, that modern Chemists maintain that corpuscles forming material compounds should be considered as masses.</p>
	<p> Corpuscles, considered as intermediate components, are assumed to be inalterable. That is, an aggregate can exist in its specific form only if its constituant parts are unaltered. For example, when tin decomposes during calcination, its constituant parts are no longer tin, even if melting it down seems to produce a relationship of mass or a simple aggregate, tin oxyde glass.</p>
	<p> I am willing to allow perfect and imperfect aggregates. The first category includes those that fit the terms of the definition exactly and for which by physical means there is no way to determine whether or not they fit the definition. The imperfect aggregates are those in which some imperfection can indeed be determined by physical means. My perfect aggregate is the similar mass that Mr. Wolff has defined (cosm .249) and whose existence in nature he has denied (suiv .), and that he also seems to include under the name tuxtura . Cosmolog.nat. 75.</p>
	<p> An aggregate's imperfection always lies in a defect of uniform density.</p>
	<p> Pure liquids, homogeneous vapors, air, solid bodies like metals and glass, some non-organic animal and vegetable substances such as vegetable and animal oils and butters, liquid balms, salt cristals, and soft bodies that take the shape of their containers are perfect aggregates. Hard stones, oven-baked clay, compact stony conglomerates, soft bodies that are non-uniformly compacted, metals that are hammered or drawn, extracts, greases, etc, are imperfect aggregates.</p>
	<p> My way of understanding all perfect aggregates is the idea Newton wished to present of the expandability and compressibility of air (see Opt.quest. xxxj .) Mr. Desaguliers has expressed the same idea with more precision (see his second dissertation on rising vapors in his course on physics (leç. xj.). I picture all perfect aggregates, except absolutely dense mass, if such exists in nature, as a conglomeration of non-contiguous corpuscles, equidistant from each other. I won't pause here to establish this physical paradox because it serves me equally well whether it is a supposition or demonstrated truth. My goal is less to determine the internal disposition or composition of my aggregate than to give an accurate description of its state.</p>
	<p> The integral parts of an aggregate, considered together and separately, can be simple elementary bodies, or atoms. Or they can be material formed by the union of two or more simple bodies which Chemists call mixtures . Or formed by the union of two or more mixtures, which Chemists call compounds . Plus there are perhaps other combinations which we do not need to describe here.</p>
	<p> A mass of water is an aggregate of similar simple bodies. A mass of gold is an aggregate of similar mixtures. An amalgam is an aggregate of similar compounds. We choose the word "similar" with care in order to clarify that the aggregate's homogeneity persists even with the non-simplicity of its intergral parts and that it is absolutely independent of their own homogeneity. Its uniform density is also independent of the degree of density of its parts or of their varying porosity.</p>
	<p> This is not the moment to demonstrate all the truths that flow from the above explanation. For example, the fact that there are several essentially different elements, that the homogeneity of matter is a chimera, that inalterable materials such as water are composed of elements and the small edifice proposed by the Corpusculars and the Newtonians to help us understand the concept of a water particle rest on a shaky foundation and faulty logic. Thus, since we are writing an encyclopedia article and not the final chapters of a general scientific treatise on Chemistry, we simply propose these truths rather than trying to prove their validity. All the facts, operations, procedures and attention to detail that fill so many introductory texts could serve as the basis for these universal notions and for those that will follow. These notions can then shed the name of "suppositions" and take on the name “axioms.” They can serve initially to distinguish for any material what belongs to the mass and what belongs to its intergral parts .</p>
	<p> For example, one can conclude from the very statement of facts that a body's mechanical properties belong to its mass, that it is by their mass they they exert presssure, have weight, resist movement, and act on other bodies with a given force (for we are not dealing here with common or essential properties—their mobility, their gravity or their absolute inertia). In sum, their shape, size, movement and situation, considered as mechanical principles, are a function of their mass. As for movement, although Physicists judge the movement of the whole as the sum of the movement of its parts, they nonetheless agree that during any movement the parts remain at rest in relation to each other.</p>
	<p> All changes that an aggregate undergoes concerning the disposition and juxtaposition of its parts also affect the aggregate. We are unable to examine certain areas here. For example, rarescibility, elasticity, divisibility, ductility, etc., depend only on the aptitude of change and not on internal changes affecting the constituant molecules. However in any case there are bodies whose integral parts are unaffected by such changes, whatever these bodies might be. Observation of internally inalterable bodies such as water, air, gold, mercury, etc., shows that all the above properties can be considered due to the two causes just given, although the exact cause of the specific degree of each of these properties can be found of course in the internal make-up or in the essence of the integral parts of each aggregate.</p>
	<p> We can state the same thing about certain internal movements that some aggregates undergo, for example, the movement that is the essence of liquidity, according to Descartes and the witness of our own senses. I use the phrase witnessed by our own senses because the act of boiling, which we can easily sense, is different from liquidity only by degree, and thus, strictly speaking, any liquid in its state of calm liquidity is a body that can boil. That is, it can be agitated by an outside agent, fire, and it is not a body whose parts must necessarily remain at rest, as more than one Newtonian has proven by geometrical axioms. Axioms in geometry are all well and good. But geometrical Physicists expose such axioms to the ridicule of non-geometrical Physicists whenever they propose a demonstration as a replacement for a physical fact, and a false or gratuitous supposition, either tacit or expressed, in place of a physical principal based on observation and which can be captured by the senses, as in the above case. In this matter I can believe D'Alembert as readily as I believe Stahl who decries transmutation . For example, when Mr. Desaguliers rigorously demonstrated that all parts of a homogeneous liquid are at rest and that quite simply, the liquid could not come to a boil, he did so, it seems to me, because he tacitly assumed that all the parts of a liquid are free, sui juris . Simple observation, however, demonstrates to the senses that fire agitates the component parts continuously and that liquidity cannot exist without heat. That is what almost all the Newtonians seem to disregard, although their master so stated expressly. See optiq. quest. Xxxj. To return to my subject, I claim that liquidity and boiling, which is liquidity taken to the extreme, can be related only to mass, and that it is so for water and for certain other liquids.</p>
	<p> The qualities of bodies that our senses can determine are not always the same as those of their constituant parts. A supple material can be composed of parts that are quite stiff, as we agree is the case of water. It would be ridiculous to look for the cause of sound in the changes taking place among the integral parts of a sonorous body. And the perceived color of a mass of gold, it's yellow nuances, doesn't belong to the tiniest particle which makes up gold, even though that particle must have color, and even though facts demonstrate that it does indeed, but not in the same way as the mass. This could be proven completely (see the chemical doctrine on colors at the word Phlogistique), but, as I’ve said, I’m not concerned with establishing such truths just now. It’s enough for me to establish that it is at least possible to conceive of a mass formed by particles which have none of the properties of the mass itself. That it is very easy to imagine a mass of gold, that is yellow, shiny, ductile, compressible, divisible by mechanical means, able to become a liquid, condensable, elastic, having nineteen times the weight of water. One can imagine such a body formed by an assemblage of particles that are also gold, but which have none of the qualities that I’ve just outlined. That assertion is so obvious from what I’ve just proposed that proof based on experiments seems as unnecessary as trying to prove experimental Physics by demonstrating the force of levers. However, if some readers are curious about further proof, they can find it in what we will say later about the imitation of gold.</p>
	<p> I judge all these qualities as external , or physical qualities, and I will note immediately that they are also accidental , according to scholastic language, because they could disappear without the corpuscle being destroyed or cease being material. Or, which is to say the same thing in another way, they are unnecessary for the specification of the body; not only because they could disappear without the specific nature of the body being changed, but also because they could also be found in a body of another variety. For although it is difficult to find two bodies internally different but having many similar external qualities, and although this difficulty is still great even when one chooses one of the two bodies from among the most extreme in its category, the most perfect as is gold among the metals, the external similarity doesn't clash with essential internal differences. For example, I could place gold and another body in such a way that they look alike from the outside and even so that they have the same specific gravity. Though it is difficult to find a non-metallic material with the same specific gravity as gold, there is nothing easier to do than reducing gold's specific gravity. The man who can bring these two bodies to close external resemblance can say of his imitated gold en aurum Physicorum , just as Diogenes said about his crested rooster en hominem Platonis .</p>
	<p> In addition to all these properties that I have called external or physical , I also observe in every aggregate qualities that I might generically call internal for the time being, expecting that I'll one day be able to call them chemical and to distinguish them by that particular denomination of other qualities of the same kind, such as the very common qualities of bodies—occupying space, impenetrability, inertia, mobility, etc. The qualities I'm talking about here are particular internal qualities. They constitute a body as it really is, so that water, gold, saltpeter, etc, are water, gold, saltpeter, etc, and not other substances. For water, these qualities include simplicity, volatility, the faculty to dissolve salts and to become one of the materials of the resulting mixture, etc. For gold, these qualities include its metallic nature, its fixity, its solubility by mercury and by a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid. For saltpeter, we see neutral salinity, the form of its crystals, its ability to be decomposed by phlogiston and by vitriolic acid, etc. All of these qualities belong essentially to the integral parts.</p>
	<p> All of these qualities depend upon each other in a way which it is not necessary to elaborate here, and they are all quite common. Gold, for example, is soluble by mercury as a metal. As a perfect metal it is not transformable. It is soluble in hydrochloric/nitric acid according to a degree of specific affinity as a perfect metal, that is as gold.</p>
	<p> As far as these external qualities are concerned, some of them are not essential to bodies except relative to our own experience, our current knowledge. The non-transformability of gold, the volatility of mercury, the inamalgability of iron, etc., are internal qualites of this kind. The source of problems of the least common practical Chemistry lies in the discovery of contrary qualities.</p>
	<p> There are other internal properties that are so inherent to bodies that they can exist only in conjunction with those bodies. These are the properties whose very cause resides in the elementary substance or in the nature of the mixture of specific corpuscles of each body. Thus saltpeter must be formed by the union of the acid we call nitric acid and of fixed alkali, and water is composed of a specific element, etc.</p>
	<p> All the distinctions proposed up to now can be considered as simple truths of analytical precision since we have considered only the qualities of bodies. Now we shall see that the differences they display as physical agents are no less remarkable.</p>
	<p> 1. Masses exert on each other actions which are distinct from the action inherent in corpuscles, and these actions follow laws that are absolutely different from those governing effects on corpuscles. Bodies bump and press against each other, resist each other, divide, are lifted up, are lowered, surround themselves, penetrate each other, etc., some of them because of their velocity, their masse, their specific gravity, their consistence and their respective shapes. And they follow similar laws, whether the actions have to do with homogeneous masses or with those that are specifically different. A marble column, all things being equal, can support a mass of marble or a mass of lead. A hammer made of any appropriate material can drive in a nail of any appropriate material. The mutual interactions of corpuscles are not related to any of these qualities. The only interaction the corpuscles undergo is the interaction related to their aggregate union or separation, to their mixture, to their decomposition and other similar phenomena. There is nothing related to shocks, to pressure, to friction, to weaving, to penetration, to wedges, to levers, to velocity, to size, to shape, etc., although certain forms and sizes may seem to be necessary for certain actions. These actions depend upon the internal qualities of corpuscles, among which homogeneity and heterogeneity need to be considered initially as essential conditions. For the formation of aggregates happens only with homogeneous substances, as we've noted earlier. Heterogeneity is on the other hand essential in mixtures. (see Mixture, Decomposition, Separation)</p>
	<p> 2. All masses gravitate toward a common center or have weight. They all have measurable weight in proportion to the quantity of matter in a specific volume. The absolute gravity of each corpuscle cannot be demonstrated (See Principles & Phlogiston). Their specific gravity is not known.</p>
	<p> 3. Masses hold together due to their proximity, their size and their shape. Corpuscles do not obey the same law. It's because of their relationship or affinity that they unite. (See Rapport). Reciprically, masses are not subject to the law of affinities. Dissolving action supposes on the contrary the aggregrate's destruction (see Solvent), and from the union of one mass with a mass of a different nature a new homogeneous body can never result.</p>
	<p> 4. Corpuscles can be separated from each under the effect of heat, and that case doesn't need to be explained by Newton's repulsion . Heat does not cause masses to move away from each other. (see Fire)</p>
	<p> 5. Certain corpuscles, but no mass, can become vapor. (See Volatility)</p>
	<p> So far we have opposed corpuscles to aggregates only as each is considered separately, and we have not looked at the interior composition of corpuscles. This aspect can provide us with new distinctive characteristics, which follow:</p>
	<p> 1. Aggregates are homogeneous. Corpuscles are either simple or composed of materials that are essentially different. The first part of this proposition is founded on a definition or a query. The second expresses a similar truth, and besides it can be supported by our vast experience in this matter. (See Mixing)</p>
	<p> 2. Materials constituting compound corpuscles differ not only from each other, but also from the corpuscle which results from their union and consequently from the aggregate formed by the assemblage of these corpuscles. Thus fixed alkali and nitric acid are different from saltpeter and a mass of saltpeter. If such division is continued all the way to the elemental level, we have the basis of the difference between a mass and a simple body. (See our doctrine on elements under the word Principe .)</p>
	<p> 3. Principles of mixtures or of the composition of corpuscles are connected by a link different from the one governing the formation of aggregates or relationships of mass. The first can be broken down by mechanical as well as by chemical means. The second can be separated by chemical means alone, for example, dissolution and heat. And in certain cases, the link is indissoluble, at least by ordinary means. Gold, silver, mercury and a limited number of other bodies are mixtures of this last type. (see Mixture).</p>
	<p> The limits imposed on us do not allow further consideration of these ideas. The propositions we have developped, however, though they are simply stated for the most part, I believe sufficiently prove the properties of masses and the properties of the different principles which explain them. They can can indeed be understood by abstract considerations and are physically different in several ways. Therefore we can now suspect that the physical nature of non-organic bodies can be divided according to such differences into two independent sciences, at least in terms of their specific interests. And indeed, these two sciences already exist, for such division is quite natural. The main interest of each science so closely matches the two categories we've just established that the division preceding its rationale is a new proof of the truth that allows us to distinguish between them.</p>
	<p> One of these sciences is ordinary Physics, not the universal Physics that is so often laid out at the beginning of texts in Physics, but rather a less ambitious Physics that is actually described in these texts.</p>
	<p> The second is Chemistry .</p>
	<p> Ordinary Physics, which from now on I shall call simply Physics , is limited to properties of masses, or at least that is its primary object. Any reader can verify that statement: 1. from the table of contents of any treatise on Physics, 2. by going to the trouble of skimming the definitions of the general categories that are examined and the different manifestations of those categories (for example, movement), and then determining for which bodies physicists study movement, and finally , 3. by considering the limited number of particular objects dealt with by Phyics and which we also share, such as water, air, fire, etc. Research of that kind will reveal that Physics always deals with masses and that movement which interests Physicists is the movement unique to masses. For the Physicist, air is a liquid that after compression can easily regain its prior form, that takes on equilibirum with liquids it contains at particular altitudes and circumstances, whose currents known as winds have particular velocities, and that is a material through which sound rays travel. In short, for a Physicist, air is simply atmospheric air, and consequently it is an aggregate or a mass. For him, water is a non-compressible wet liquid, able to change to ice and to steam, subject to all the laws of hydraulics and hydrostatics, and it is the material of rain and other water-based precipitation, etc. But all of these properties are clearly properties of mass, excepting humidity. And humidity is difficult to understand in passing, for I would invite anyone to show me any liquid that is not wet, not even excepting mercury, and I will agree that humidity might indeed not be a property of every liquid. As far as fire is concerned,and its essential quality as Boerhaave describes this fluid, that is its faculty to rarefy other bodies, it is clear that this property is related to a mass or aggregate of fire. Thus we can affirm that all but five or six lines of Boerhaave's treatise on fire deal with Physics. Light, another general property of fire, belongs to the aggregate of fire alone.</p>
	<p> Most physical objects can be sensed either directly or through their immediate effects. A mass has a determinable form. A mass in movement crosses measurable space in measurable time. It can be slowed down by detectable objects, and the deceleration can be measured, etc. An elastic mass can be flattened by a shock on a determinable part of its surface, and this action is governed by geometrical precision concerning the shapes, forces, and movements related to such bodies. Mass provides geometers measurable principles, upon which they are able to develop theories , which, since Newton's work endows Physics with such sublime knowledge, are the basis for Physics.</p>
	<p> Today's Physics is thus specifically the collection of all physico-mathematical sciences. Up to the present day, we have calculated only forces and effects of masses. For although the deepest operations of transcendent Geometry act on infinitely small objects, these objects pass quickly from abstraction to the state of mass. They are therefore figurative masses, endowed with central forces, etc. Once they are considered as physical entitities, the tiny bodies of the Geometer/Physicist are not to same thing as those corpuscles that we have opposed to masses. Calculations of such bodies done with the wisdom and genius we so admire do not however make it possible to calculate chemical effects, or at least have not led so far to such calculations.</p>
	<p> Physicians try to reduce all natural phenomena to mechanical laws, and the most honorable name one can give to the causes they determine, to the agents that they put forward in their explanations, is to call them mechanical .</p>
	<p> Physics can speak for itself about the nature of its study that we attribute to it, especially since we haven't tried to take away from Physics what it has usurped from us and the discussion of which should be flattering. All we have said is that the proper object of its study is the consideration of masses.</p>
	<p> Chemistry , however, deals primarily with changes involving different orders of principles that govern detectable bodies. The brief outline, both practical and theoretical, that we will try to sketch in a moment should demonstrate Chemistry's object of study.</p>
	<p> Before doing that, however, in order to establish the contrast between Phyics and Chemistry , we would like to make the following observations:</p>
	<p> 1. All chemical movement is an internal movement, the movement of digestion, of fermentation, of effervescence. For Chemists, air is one of the principles of the composition of bodies, especially of solids, uniting with different principles according to the laws of affinity , separating off by chemical means, heat and precipitation . It is volatile, passing directly from the solid state to an expanded gaseous state without ever being liquid even at the coldest known temperatures, a new way of looking at things that offers protections from the pettiness of some physicists. For Chemists, water is an element, or a simple body, indivisible and unchangeable, an idea which goes against the opinions of Thales, Van Helmont, Boyle and Mr. Eller, according to which water unites chemically with salts, gums, etc. Water is one of the materials forming these bodies, and it is the immediate instrument of fermentation, etc. Fire, considered as a particular chemical object, is a principle capable of combination and precipitation, conferring to those mixtures of which it is the principle, color, inflammability, metalicity, etc. And thus, the treatise on fire, known by the name of Stahl's trecenta , is entirely chemical.</p>
	<p> We stress the expression fire considered as a particular chemical object , because fire as aggregate , considered as principle of heat, is not a chemical object but an instrument used by the Chemist in chemical operations or a universal agent whose chemical effects the Chemist can observe in nature's laboratory.</p>
	<p> In general, although the Chemist works only with aggregates , since bodies appear to a Chemist in that form only, these aggregates are always simply the promptuaria (storehouse) of the truly chemical subjects, that is, of corpuscles. All of the truly chemical alterations that the Chemist attempts can be reduced to two. He may directly attack its integral parts by combining them one with another or in small quantities with the integral parts of a body of a different nature. That process is called chemical dissolution or syncresis. (See Solvent, Syncresis, and the rest of this article) This dissolution is the only chemical change that can occur with an aggregate of elements. Or, the Chemist can break down the integral parts of the aggregate, and that process is called chemical analysis or diacresis. (See Diacresis, Analyse Végétal under the listing Plant and the rest of this article). In short, as long as we are dealing only with the relationships of the aggregrate's integral parts with each other, the phenomenon is not chemical, even though it may be caused by chemical agents. For example, even subdividing an aggregate down to its individual units is not chemical. The same is true of the effects of pulverization. In order for diacresis to be a chemical process, it must separate specifically dissimilar parts.</p>
	<p> We must also point out that certain internal changes due to the effect of heat on an aggregate body are truly chemical only when the energy from these changes affects the internal make-up of the corpuscles. These changes being in general simply graduated effects from the same cause, they must be considered mixtures or as effects whose physical nature is well-known to the Chemist. Included among such effects due to moderate heat, effects that we shall call specifically physical , are, for example, rarefaction of bodies, their liquifaction, ebullition, evaporation, the exercising of elastic force in compressed bodies, etc. Thus Chemists are also good physicists when dealing with all questions of this kind. It seems to me, that when considering these effects, working from the analogy of those effects whose cause is most obvious (and those are objects that only Chemists examine) with those whose cause is more hidden, I am able to bring together two phenomena that are often considered only separately. For example, the discovery that the mechanism of elasticity is the same in all bodies, that all bodies are susceptible to the same degree of elasticity. It is due only to accidental circumstances that different bodies around us have specific differences in that regard. Elasticity is only a mode of low or high density, and consequently it is always due to heat just like all other phenomena attributed to Newtonian repulsion, which is really only heat. (See Fire, Rapport)</p>
	<p> 2. Chemical objects do not act in such a way that they can always be sensed. The immediate effect of fire and dissolution, the two great chemical agents, cannot be perceived by the senses. The time it takes for a mixture to occur cannot be measured, in instanti . Consequently such operations are not calculable, or at least thus far attempts to calculate them have not met with success.</p>
	<p> 3. Chemists find no glory in working with mechanical agents, and they find it strange that mechanical principles, often just barely distinguishable from an unknown cause, have become so dear to philosophers and that they have caused them to to reject any theory based on unknown causes, as if being true were identical to being intelligible. It is as if the interposition of a mechanical principle between an unknown cause and its effect protected them from the horror of the unintelligible . In any case, the reason Chemists do not accept mechanical principles is not because they have a contrary spirit but because none of the known mechanical principles intervene in the Chemist's operations. People often unfairly criticize Chemists for revelling in their obscurity. For such a criticism to be reasonable, one would need to show them priniciples that are both evident and certain. For Chemists cannot be blamed for prefering obscurity to error. And indeed, if their way of doing philosophy is so ridiculous, then they are ready to share that ridicule with Aristotle, Newton, and a host of ancient philosphers whom Mr. De Buffon has described in his natural history as having a broader philosophy because their genius was unlimited. For the ancients were less disturbed than are we by facts they couldn't explain. They understood nature better. For them a relationship or a correspondance was simply a phenomon, whereas for us, if we aren’t able to associate it with our supposed laws of motion, it becomes a paradox. The ancients realized that nature brings about most of its effects by unknown means and that we are unable to enumerate natures’ ressources. What is truly ridiculous is to attempt to limit nature by reducing it to a number of principles of action and means of operation. To propose a cause, it was enough for the ancients to notice a sufficient number of similar related effects. Is that not what Chemists do?</p>
	<p> Chemists would readily and thankfully accept any mechanical explanation that is not contradicted by facts. They would be delighted, for example, to allow themselves to be convinced, along with J. Keill and Freind, that the mechanisim of effervescence and fermentation consists of the mutual action of certain solid elastic corpuscles that act upon each other by force, that take flight in proportion to their elasticity and velocity, and that continue to bump against each other and fly off in all directions. But such an explanation, as ingenious as it is arbitrary, is contradicted by facts that clearly show that effervescent motion and fermentation are due to the production of a subtle expandable body, caused by the general laws of affinities, which are not at all a mechanical principle. (See Effervescence and Fermentation)</p>
	<p> Rather than being reduced to making the simple statement that the process of dissolution is nothing but the result of a certain tendancy or relationship by which two mixable bodies are drawn toward each other, wouldn't Chemists prefer understanding the process through the easily perceived image of, on the one hand, a solvent armed with hard, solid, massive, sharp parts, and on the other a body with an infinite number of pores that are proportional to the mass and form of the solvent? According to that image, after the repeated blows of the solvent's parts against the body to be dissolved, and after the forced penetration of those parts into the pores, then finally the edifice is weakened and its substance breaks apart. That is the picture used by Physicists to explain the phenomenon. Truly Chemists would prefer to understand dissolution in this way, because it is an explanation that rests upon knowledge, that enlarges the scope, and because the prominence of this kind of scholarship is not purely imaginary, and on the other hand, a stark limited description doesn’t bring honor to the scientist. But the explanation fails to take into account essential circumstances of the phenomenon that we have tried to explain, and whether or not the destruction of the dissolved body’s mass, which we have just gone to such trouble to describe, is purely accidental to dissolution, which happens in the same way with two liquids. These accidental circumstances so rivet the theoretician’s attention that he totally neglects dissolution’s essential circumstances, that is the union of two substances. Consequently, it is not possible to accept coins of such spurious alloy. Boerhaave himself, whom we love to cite and praise when the occasion arrises, understood the weakness of the above explanation and refuted it. (See Boerhaave, de menstruis, Element. Chymia , part . II .)</p>
	<p> We would like to believe along with Freind that, of all chemical operations, dissolution is the one that can be explained the most easily by mechanical laws. As does Freind, we would prefer being able to accept the two basic causes. The first is that the solvent becomes lighter with the addition of a less heavy liquid, and the second is that the affusion of a heavy liquid, flowing slowy, carries with it particles of the dissolved body, etc. But too many facts demonstrate the fallibility of such gratuitous suppositions. Pour as much wine alcohol as you like into a totally saturated solution of a neutral deliquescent salt, for example natural sulfur, and not an atom of precipitate will fall out. A body dissolved in the highest concentration of vitriolic acid will remain dissolved if you add water to the solution, etc. Allow mercury, the heaviest liquid found in nature, to drop at whatever velocity you like into a solution of a neutral salt, saline or earthen, and nothing will separate out.</p>
	<p> We would be pleased to be able to say along with Boyle that the necessary conditions for immutability are the size of the constituent parts of a fixed body, gravity or the solidity of its corpuscles and finally their inaptitude to evaporate due to their branched, hooked, curved, in sum, irregular forms, which prevent their separation from each other, because it is as if they are interlaced, etc. And we would like to be able to explain volatility by the opposite qualities. But the facts counter all such ideas. For bodies gain volatility as they gain size, as does luna cornea (silver chloride). Should Boyle say to me, and I'm sure that he would, that sea acid makes luna cornea lighter by extending its surface, I'd respond by saying that it should also harm the third condition by increasing the irregularity of its surface and thus strengthen the quality of enlaceability, etc. Some heavy or solid bodies are volatile, such as mercury. Some light and less dense bodies are non-volatile, such as the fixed alkalis, etc. In short, as far as the enlaced shapes are concerned, these spires so dear to Boyle, and indeed so ingenious, we have to admit that we wish they really did exist. But the phenomena of mixtures, of precipitations, of rarefactions, of coagulations, etc., demonstrate too clearly that any union of small particles is done by juxtaposition, and therefore we can’t be comfortable with such purely imaginary mechanisms. In any case, Newton’s teaching, following Becher’s on this point, as I have noted elsewhere, has already discredited those ideas sufficiently without it being necessary to refute them further. In short, the mechanical actions that are proposed here have no basis. We even defy anyone to present an explanation of a chemical process founded on known mechanical laws whose false or gratuitous nature we would not be able to demonstrate.</p>
	<p> It is clear that two sciences that consider objects from such different points of view must each inevitably produce particular and distinct knowledge and each develop a number of compound notions. They will each have a certain way of considering and dealing with their subjects, and each way will produce a different language, method and operating procedure. The Physicist will see masses, forces, and qualities. The Chemist will see small bodies, relationships and principles. The Physicist will calculate carefully and will reduce measured effects and forces to theories; that is, he will subject the effects and forces to calculations (for such is the theory of the modern physicist). He will also establish laws that can be almost confirmed by experimentation (I say almost, because Mathematicians themselves admit that the forces whose exercise they calculate are always based on modo nihil obstet , and a case in which there is no opposition does not exist in nature. The theories of Chemists will be vague and approximative. They will be clear explanations of nature and of the chemical properties of certain substances or of particular principles considered in all their combinations that might exist in nature or in the laboratory. They will explain a substance's relationship with bodies and principles of a particular class and all the changes it might undergo or that it might produce through such relationships and combinations. All his work will be based on major basic facts discovered by what I shall call an experimental sense, based indeed on indices gathered from vague experiments or blind searching, but never resulting immediately from those tools. (See Phlogiston, Nitre, Sea salt , Vitriol, etc.) In short, the physicist's genius, raised to the highest human levels, produces the mathematical principles of Newton, and the corresponding production in chemistry is surely Stahl’s Specimen Becherianum .</p>
	<p> As long as Chemists and Physicists each philosophize in their own manner on the objects of their study, continuing to analyze and compare them, bringing them together and combining them, and as long as on their common projects the science that has seen the most sets the tone, things will be fine.</p>
	<p> But if some people are confused by the distinctions we have made, either because they haven't suspected the existence and the necessity of this distinction either because of short-sightedness or because they have simply rejected them out of stubbornness, then all is not well. The Chemist, for example, might get involved with physical objects of study, but know only Chemistry . Or the Physicist might propose laws for Chemistry , knowing about only physical phenomena. If the one applies laws pertaining to masses to changes in small bodies, or if the other tries to transfer what happens with small bodies to actions of masses, if one treats more chimico things that are physical, and the other treats more physico things chemical, if one tries to dissolve a salt with a wedge, or make a mill turn by dissolution, then things are not well at all.</p>
	<p> Has any one ordinary chemist or physicist ever been able to grasp the general science of bodies and claimed to cover all its common elements with his own particular understanding? If so, the general science he presents will be defective and wrong. When he tries to synthesize, using the principles he thinks are general and the facts he thinks he can count on, he is bound to go astray. All of the Physical Metaphysics, or to use Wolf's word, all the Cosmologies that I am aware of were written by Physicists. Some of them of course, are clearly stamped with genius. I can even go so far as to say that some are impossible to tear down and refute, because they are carefully constructed chains of abstract notions and nominal definitions that the metaphysicist has laid out and circumscribed in his manner. But in spite of that, the general science of the properties of bodies is more solid and real than that. When I use the expression the general science of bodies , I mean physical bodies such as those we can observe in nature, in all their conditions, and not bodies unhampered by those conditions and thus almost destroyed by abstractions.</p>
	<p> We can be sure for most of the supposed general truths that are the basis for subsisting general systems, including Leibnitz's famous principles and what Mr. Merian wrote about Spinozism in his treatise on apperception hist. De l'acad. De Prusse 1749 , that it is in the passage from abstraction to the real world that such truths can be tested. All we need to do is try to make that leap and we see that the colossal edifice collapses. From the different sources we have just indicated, thousands of errors have arisen. To those who have proposed them, we could confidently say, borrowing from Apelle’s famous witticism: Lower your voice; our coal porters would laugh if they heard you . The exact list of all such errors that have come to our attention might be useful in the interest of truth and in the interest of supporting good doctrine, but it would be infinite. They would be worth including in a book entitled Institutions of Physics/Chemistry whose goal could be to substitute truth for all those errors. We ask the reader to be content for the moment with those errors we have already cited and others that follow. I don’t know of any true chemist who hasn’t dared to make incursions into the realm of physics. If so, we judge them misguided and as foolhardy has those Physicists who have ventured onto our territory. They are misguided and we disown them.</p>
	<p> Chemistry is a science whose business it is to study the separation and union of the principal constituant parts of bodies, in both nature and the laboratory. Its goal is to discover the qualities of those bodies or to find uses for them.</p>
	<p> The particular subjects studied by Chemistry are those phenomena, be they natural or artificial, that are related to the separation and union of particles of substances. Natural phenomena include the ripening of fruits, the formation of glues, extracts, resins, vegetable salts, etc., as well as the elaboration and various alterations of food coming from animals and their diverse forms. They also include the generation of metals, stones, natural crystals, fossil salts, sulfur and tars, as well as the impregnation and heat of mineral waters, the heating of volcanoes, the nature of lightning and other expressions of fire in the atmosphere, etc. In short, these phenomena include all of those categorized as Physical Botany, except not those belonging to the organization of the plant world, those belonging to the branch of animal systems based the activity of the humours, those belonging to the chemical world that Becher has called subterranean physics or that are due to chemical changes within bodies or those that give off in the atmosphere certain detached matter from the vegetable, animal or mineral realms.</p>
	<p> Artificial chemical phenomena are those that are observed during chemical operations and those upon which the theories of such operations are based.</p>
	<p> We call operations all those particular means used to induce in the objects of our study the two great changes enunciated in our definition of Chemistry , that is separation and union.</p>
	<p> Such operations are either fundamental and chemical, or they are simply preparatory and mechanical. (See Chemical procedures).</p>
	<p> The two basic general and immediate effects of all chemical operations, that is the separation and the union of principles, are generally better known in the field by the names diacresis and synchresis . The first operation is also called by some chemists by other names, including analysis, decomposition, corruption, solution and destruction. The second operation is also called mixing, generation, synthesis, combination, coagulation and even confusion by some. Each of these terms is understood in a more a less general sense by various authors, and sometimes the same authors use them in different ways. The word mixtion , for example, signifies according to the doctrine of Becher and Stahl at times the union of different principles in general, and at times the union of elements in particular. Or sometimes it refers to the mixtures themselves. (See Mixing).</p>
	<p> The names most in use by French Chemists are analysis and decompostion for the first operation and combination or mixtion for the second.</p>
	<p> There are few chemical operations that produce only one of these effects or that can be seen as only diacresis or syncresis. Most are complex. That is, they may produce both separations and unions that are linked by cause and effect. (See Diacresis, Syncresis, Chemical procedures).</p>
	<p> Chemical operations are executed by two general agents, heat and dissolution.</p>
	<p> The action of these two agents is complicated in different ways in each operation, according to a limited number of laws which follow.</p>
	<p> 1. Heat by itself rarely brings about pure separations, and bodies resist its dissociative action all the more when they are less compound mixtures. Simple bodies and perfect mixtures are inalterable by heat alone, at least by the degree of heat that we are able to apply in closed vessels, that is, without the help of air, of water or of fire solutions. Some compounds are totally unaffected by this action. Among these are vitriolic tartar and marine salt, etc.</p>
	<p> 2. Heat is necessary for any dissolution, at least as a necessary condition. For it is impossible, or extremely rare, for dissolution to take place between two solid or frozen bodies (which is really the same thing), and it can happen only if the aggregation of one of the bodies is very weak. And such weakness can ordinarily be found only in a liquid state, which depends essentially on heat. The chemical axiom menstrua non agunt nisi sint soluta is based on that observation.</p>
	<p> 3. Not only must any dissolving process by supported by absolute heat to be effective, its degree of activity is proportional to the degree of heat applied, or, speaking literally, to its degree of expansion or rarified nature. As we have already observed, and as we will prove under the word Menstrue , the mechanism of dissolution doesn't depend at all upon the movement of the dissolving body. The separation of the body to be dissolved, in the way that we ordinarily describe it, gives only a false idea of the process. (See Solvent).</p>
	<p> 4. When heat is applied to a compound body, not only does it separate its different principle components, but puts them in movement, thus encouraging new combinations. For example, a plant extract is a compound substance that carries within itself principles of reaction. These principles, released by sufficient fire, exerce a solvent action by causing precipitations that allow some substances to separate out and form new combinations. (See Distillation, Precipitation, Solvent; See Analyse végétale under the word Plant; See Fire)</p>
	<p> These releases and new combinations are sufficiently widespread that we have had false ideas about operations that produce them, either because we didn't know what produced them or because we haven't been able to evaluate them. Because some early chemists didn’t undestand the true effects of heat on the principles of bodies they too often used that chemical process. And because the detractors of Chemistry didn’t realize that we could predict and even measure changes, for all the wrong reasons they opposed analysis by fire alone, the only means known to them, and combatted Chemistry which they thought consisted solely of analysis by fire (see the historical sketch at the end of this article, concerning Boyle). Because modern Chemists have discovered a better method, separation by dissolution, they have moved away from the earlier method. And since today’s science is sufficiently advanced to measure the movement of all the reactive agents excited by heat in compound bodies, we can examine them using distillation caused by the violence of fire as easily as we can propose a chemical problem in the manner of Geometers and with the same degree of usefulness.</p>
	<p> Chemists use in their operations a variety of instruments: ovens, containers, clay pots, catalysts and other tools that make up the suppellex chimica , laboratory equipment. (See Chemical instruments, Furnace, Mud, Intermediary, Laboratory, and the particular articles.)</p>
	<p> We don't agree with the useless distinction most chemists make between particular and artificial instruments on the one hand and on the other natural and general instruments, including air, fire, water and earth. For one reason, these bodies act through their internal qualities and they also undergo material chemical changes. They are thus no longer instruments but solvants. Air acts as a dissolvant during calcination, fire in reduction, water in fermentation and earth in certain fixations. (See Solvent). And secondly, the relationship or common quality by which these four substances, considered as mechanical and immediate agents are classified as natural instruments doesn't exist. It is forcing things to try to establish a common identity among fire considered as a heat source, earth that furnishes distilling equipment and ovens, water as a catalyst and air as a current that stirs up the fire in our ovens. Thirdly, two of these so-called natural instruments, earth and water, when they function at a distance, are no different in their essential function than the most mechanical and the most particular instrument. The water in a bain marie, for example, is simply a more useful means in some operations than a similar container filled with sand, ashes, metal filings, etc. It is not an instrument that is truly distinct and necessary in certain operations as some would claim, saying that distillation effected by an open fire or hot sand is essentially different from distillation in a bain marie, simply because it is done over an open fire or in hot sand. Therefore we have to abandon at least these two so-called natural instruments. As for air, its property of exciting fire does indeed distinguish it, at least in practice. But it is so far from acting as a chemical agent in this regard that we cannot really call it a distinct chemical instrument, much less a general instrument. So it is only fire or heat that can be truly considered by the name natural and general instrument. But we prefer using the terms agent or cause , as we have done up to now.</p>
	<p> The art of chemistry and its system of instrumentation and rules can be best described using the detailed explanation of the action of the two major agents, the help we get from our instruments and from the theories we use to explain our operations and chemical phenomena. A true treatise of practical Chemistry, a basic treatise on practical institutions, needs to include the entire system. To date there is no such treatise. Practically all books about Chemistry are practical histories of the three natural kingdoms and bear no comparison to our courses in Chemistry in which, following an arbitrary order, beginners learn the basics, such as the history of the chemical properties of various bodies of different types, classes and categories. It is not possible to present this history without explaining how to carry out certain operations and how to use instruments. Such study prepares the eye and the hand for experiments that are essential for helping confirm one's ideas and for helping grasp some fugitive or isolated phenomena that might indeed germinate in the philosopher's mind but whose perception depends on trained senses.</p>
	<p> In spite of the usefulness and necessity of such specific pieces of information, a chemist who has mastered them will remain a simple technician unless he is able to group them into a coherent scientific system. That's how we will be presenting them in this Dictionary. (See the various articles , including Calcination, Cementation, Distillation, Mixing, Procedure, Instrument, etc.)</p>
	<p> The three afore-mentioned natural kingdoms are three large divisions into which we have categorized chemical subjects. Minerals, plants and animals make up these divisions. (See Animal, Plant, & Mineral).</p>
	<p> The bodies belonging to each of these kingdoms are distinguishable one from another by their simplicity or by their degree of mixing. They are simple bodies, mixtures, compounds, supercompounds, etc., and their character is essential relative to the ways in which chemists undertake to examine them. (See Mixing)</p>
	<p> The analysis of all compound bodies has taught us that each of them may be decomposed directly into other substances which are essentially different. These as well can be divided into other substances that are different from each other, and they can be either simple or compound. And this separation can be continued until we get to those elements which, combined, make up the first order of composition, and which are different in nature.</p>
	<p> Chemists have generally referred to the different bodies we've just spoken about, considered as the material of other more compound bodies, as principles . They call simple bodies first principles , and sometimes call them elements . To those bodies that they can decompose, they have given the name secondary principles or principled principles. (See the doctrine of the Chemist's principles, the history of errors committed by some Chemists in this area, and the history of even greater errors committed by Physicists who are their adversaries, under the word Principe).</p>
	<p> If a Chemist manages to gather back together in an orderly fashion all those principles that he has separated in the same fashion, and if he manages to recompose a body that he has broken down, he has attained a true demonstration of Chemistry. And indeed, the art of Chemistry has reached this level of perfection in several essential areas. (See Syncresis).</p>
	<p> The use of solvent materials in chemical operations has demonstrated in tiny bodies a property to which I give the general name solubility or miscibility (see Miscibility) and with which I replace Newtonian cohesive attractions, for that attraction cannot exist between these bodies considered as matter. Matter, the object of a body's properties is only an abstract thing (see Principles) and miscible bodies are attracted to each other only according to certain relationships that require heterogeneity, in other words, through a relative rather than an absolute property. (See Rapport).</p>
	<p> I can also demonstrate that this solubility in action, or the chemical union (as well as the aggregative union or physical attraction) is continually counterbalanced by heat, and is not succeeded automatically by repulsion. Thus I differ on this matter from the Newtonians in two ways. First, because I know the cause of repulsion, which is always fire. And secondly, because I consider cohesibility and heat as two agents that counterbalance each other and that can dominate each other. Newtonians, on the other hand, consider attraction and repulsion as two isolated phenomena, one beginning when the other ends. (See Fire, Miscibility;, Rapport).</p>
	<p> The relationships and heat that we have substituted for modern Physicists' attraction and repulsion are the two grand principles of all Chemical phenomena.</p>
	<p> Those are the first lines of what one might call sapientia chimica . A few half-philosophers might be tempted to believe that we are aiming at high generalizations. But we affirm on the contrary that we have clung to those notions that spring the most directly from concrete facts and knowledge and that can help us understand Chemistry's practical side.</p>
	<p> It would indeed be possible to set aside all these numerous distinctions that we have made, all these different ways of looking at bodies, if we were to consider them from one of those superior vantage points which often demonstrate more scope than genius, paying more attention to cause and effect. But such efforts would be harmful to practical science. It would not be helpful to those who are unable to grasp the larger as well as the microscopic view. It would be harmful to those who lack the capacity that a few extraordinary men have to focus their intellectual faculties on abstract meditations, to move beyond the philosophical lethargy produced by their senses in suspension, to use their senses with greater vivacity and focus on those objects surrounding them and to study passionately all details in all their important curious minutia.</p>
	<p> Among the observatons we have made, what might at first seem to be distantly related to such lofty contemplations is simply a summary of reflections suggested by the immediate use of our senses. It is simply the experience of a technician imbued with the varnish of science. Example : In a chemical operation there is always an aggregate to decompose or sometimes the combination of certain bodies to effect. Therefore, one of the first distinctions that laboratory experience provides is to establish the respective nature of aggregation and composition . These are two fundamental terms of chemical language, and they in and of themselves can, by indicating their causes, state all the effects of heat as it is used in treating different bodies. Thus the technician might say: a specific amount of heat will melt gold, dissipate water, calcinate lead, fix saltpeter, decompose tartar, soap, an extract, an animal, etc. And science might say: a specific amount of heat will allow gold's aggregration to weaken, destroys aggregation in water, attacks the composition of lead and saltpeter, excites the reactives in tartar, soap, an extract, an animal, etc. The technician and the scientist also have their own language when talking about the phenomena of dissolving actions. The technician will say: nitric acid that is too strong will not attack silver, but if diluted by a certain amount of water and excited by a certain amount of heat, it will so dissolve it. Science might say: The aggregative union of concentrated acid is greater than its relationship with silver. Water added to the acid weakens its cohesive force and the addition of heat weakens it still further, etc. The technician doesn't generalize, but science will go on to say more generally: in every act of dissolution, the tendency toward dissolution dominates the tendency toward cohesion of the aggregrate.</p>
	<p> In all the principles that we've outlined, Metaphysics has proposed nothing that cannot be translated into the technician's simple language, as we have just shown by the prior examples. And the converse is true.</p>
	<p> But, if Chemistry contains within itself two different languages, one popular and the other scientific, it nonetheless, distinct from the other natural sciences, has its own way of looking at the world, as we have shown by our preceding exposition and will show by what we have reserved until now to complete our portrayal of Chemistry 's most distinguishing character. And that is that most of the qualities of bodies the Physicist considers as modes are real substances that the Chemist is able to separate out, put back together, or carry over to other bodies. Among these we include color, the principle of inflammability, taste, odor, etc.</p>
	<p> What is fire ?, says the Physicist. Is it not a body heated to such a point that it throws off abundant light? Is red-hot iron something different from fire? And what are glowing embers if they are not red-hot wood? (Newton, Opt. Qust. 9) However, burning charcoal is no more fire than a soaking sponge is water. For the chemist is able to remove the principle of inflammability, that is fire, as he is able to squeeze water out of the sponge and collect it in another container.</p>
	<p> For the Physicist, the color in a colored body is a certain disposition of the body's surface which allows it to reflect particular rays. But for the Chemist, a plant's greenness is inherent to a specific green resinous body, and he is able to remove it from the plant. Clay’s blue coloring is due to a metallic material that he is able to separate out. Even the blue of jasper, which seems so closely united to the fossil substance, has been extracted, according to Becher’s famous experiment.</p>
	<p> It's appropriate to observe that in presenting color phenomena Physicists and Chemists make different, but not contractictory statements. The Chemist simply goes one step further. And he can go still further if, when you ask about the make-up of the plant's green resin or the clay’s metallic subtance, he doesn’t fall back on some occult explanation and if he knows about a body, a physical or particular substance to which he can assign as the reason for the color. And indeed, he does know about such a body, phlogiston. In short, when dealing with the properties of compounds and mixtures, the Chemist seeks to find out the principal parts, and he never stops his analysis until he has reached the level of the elements, bodies that he can no longer break down into smaller parts. (See Phlogiston, Fire, Flammable, Taste, Odor, etc.)</p>
	<p> Up to now we have considered Chemistry as the general science of small bodies and as a vast source of knowledge about nature. Its particular application in different areas has produced various branches of Chemistry and different chemical arts. The two branches of Chemistry that have been cultivated the most scientifically and which have thus become the basis of the philosophical chemist's work and the foundation of his experiments are the art of preparing medicines (see Pharmacy) and the art of working mines and purifying metals on a small or grand scale. (See Metallurgy, and Docimasie.)</p>
	<p> The knowledge that Chemistry has provided for rational medicine might also allow us to consider medicinal theory rising from it as a branch of Chemistry . Medicinal theory is an essential element in the present state of medical theory, whether one rejects it or accepts it on firm facts, because it is founded on particular chemical changes in foods and humours. We are willing, regretfully, to admit that this knowledge is insufficiently widespread and less useful to practical medicine than Boerhaave claimed (See Element. Chim. Part. 2. usus chimi in medendo). For in Boerhaave's work we often see the dangerous plan to draw truly medicinal truths from knowledge based on physics. (See Medicine).</p>
	<p> We have decided not to talk about Alchemy in this article. (See Hermetic philosophy).</p>
	<p> Making glass and porcelain, the art of enamels, painting on glass (which is not a lost art in spite of the general opinion), pottery, zymotechnics (the art of encouraging fermentation among vegetable subtances, including wine-making), the art of the brewer and the vinegar maker, halotechnics (the art of preparing salts), pyrotechnics the art of making fireworks), the work of tanners and of soapmakers, the art of varnishes and of engraving with acids, dyeing, the preparation of horn, scales and animal hair, the distiller's art, the work of the candy-maker and the drink-mixer, all of these are three branches of pharmacy. The art of breadmaking, panificium , and cooking, etc. are all chemical arts. (See these particular articles).</p>
	<p> Other than the arts that we have just spoken about and which are essentially related to chemical operations, there are others whose basic operations are not chemical but to which Chemistry offers necessary help. Certain chemical products provide the most effective principles of movement, for example in gunpowder, whose use is common knowledge, and steam in the heat pump, etc. Paintings most brilliant and durable colors are gifts of Chemistry , for example.</p>
	<p> The strangest and most magical branch of natural magic is the one in which chemical agents operate. Different kinds of phosphorus, oils ignited by acids, exploding powders, violent effervescences, artificial vulcanoes, the production, destruction and sudden changes in the color of certain liquids, unexpected precipitations and coagulations can astonish and amuse people even in our enlightened times, not to mention such apparent fantasies as the philospher's stone, Parecelsus's homunculus, the miracles of palengenesis and all such marvels. (See Chemical recreations).</p>
	<p> Since chemical arts are linked to general Chemistry as to a common trunk, there seem to be two important questions that we must raise. 1. How much can each of these arts be improved and modified by the science of chemistry? and 2. How can the science of chemistry progress using the particular knowledge that arises from working in each of these arts?</p>
	<p> As for the first question, it is evident that the best educated and enlightened chemist will direct, reform, and perfect any particular chemical art more or less effectively in proportion to his general knowledge and his science. He will do so, however, on the condition that he has gained the faculty to judge the process as a worker does, that is with feeling and with the experience that come from a hands-on manipulation of the process. It is a fact and easily observable that no scientific means can replace such experience.</p>
	<p> The second question requires familiarizing oneself with all of the operations and processes of the chemical arts, following the great chemist Stahl's advice and example. That seems indispensable for the chemist who aspires to expand his understanding of his art. For it is a fascinating and philosophical spectacle to examine the multiple chemical techniques, to consider how they can be used together for different means and how genius is displayed among simple techicians (though technicians call it simply good sense). And these lessons arising from good sense as well as from the technicians' industriousness, facility and experience must not be neglected. In short, one needs to be an artist, a trained and experienced artist, if for no other reason than to be able to execute or direct different processes with the same facility, the same knowledge of resources, the same promptitude which make these operations a game, a pleasure and a captivating spectacle instead of a long painful discouraging exercise during which disheartening obstacles interfere and success is uncertain. All such isolated phenomena, these so-called bizarre operations, this variety of products and singularity of the results of experiments that half-chemists blame on the techniques of chemistry or on unknown properties of the materials they are working with can all be atributed to the artist’s inexperience. They rarely arise with experienced Chemists. It is very rare, and perhaps it never happens, that a true chemist is unable to replicate a product using the same materials. The artist we speak about will never think it sufficient to judge the degree of the heat he uses by thermometers, or the number of drops during a distillation process by a clock with a second hand. Rather, as technicans often say, he will have his thermometer in the tips of his fingers and his clock in his head. In short, he is able to conduct ordinary processes and his daily operations using rough estimations based on his senses, and because of their ease of use, these estimations are preferable when they are sufficient. The chemist learns how to estimate most chemical operations with a great deal of precision. All of the artificial measurements that some would have us use are cumbersome and sometimes impossible, especially thermometers, that are as ridiculous in a working chemist’s apron as they are in a doctor’s pocket when he visits his patients. But the value of the skilled technician is not limited to this advantage. An additional value is that the chemist can draw broader enlightened conclusions from the phenomena that arise during the processes he executes. In such phenomena, the kind that the chancellor Bacon talks about, a chemist can find the springboard for the foundation and development of an important theory. These phenomena might awaken the chemist’s genius, just as the falling apple incited Newton to produce his magnificent system of universal gravitation . Futhermore, it is necessary to sing the praises of experimentation only for those who have never tried their hand at experiments or who have never been able to judge the value of a skilled experienced chemist. For anyone who has lived among the chemist’s furnaces for even six months or who, understandng chemisty, has heard chemists discussing their art, it is clear that the experienced artist is superior to the most profound speculative thinker.</p>
	<p> The wisest Chemists agree that an interest in Chemistry is really a madman's passion. And that is because the Chemist must know all these practical processes, must be patient through long tedious experiments and observe them with painstaking care, must cover his expenses, must confront the dangers of the experiments and the temptation to lose sight of everything else. Becher calls Chemists Certum quoddam genus hominum excentricum, heteroclitum, heterogeneum, anomalum ; a man who has a singular obsession, quo sanitas, pecunia, tempus & vita perduntur . But if we accept as given the usefulness of the sciences, and that seems to be the general opinion, then these same difficulties and disadvantages force us to consider those scientists who demonstrate sufficient courage to confront them as citizens who merit our deep gratitude.</p>
	<p> Whatever idea we may have of this passion for chemistry, when did it begin to torment men? When do we situate the birth of Chemistry ? Though it would be of value to have such information, it would be difficult to determine.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.</p>
	<p> Chemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other natural sciences, including physics, geology and biology. For the differences between chemistry and physics see comparison of chemistry and physics.</p>
	<p> The history of chemistry can be traced to alchemy, which had been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> The word chemistry comes from alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. It is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold, though in ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early 4th century Greek-Egyptian alchemist Zosimos. An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as "chemistry".</p>
	<p> The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الکیمیاء). In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία. This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Chemi or Kimi, which is the ancient name of Egypt in Egyptian. Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία, meaning "cast together".</p>

	<h3> Definition</h3>
	<p> In retrospect, the definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. The term "chymistry", in the view of noted scientist Robert Boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies. In 1663 the chemist Christopher Glaser described "chymistry" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.</p>
	<p> The 1730 definition of the word "chemistry", as used by Georg Ernst Stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles. In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered the word "chemistry" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces. This definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances - a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling. More recently, in 1998, Professor Raymond Chang broadened the definition of "chemistry" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<p> Early civilizations, such as the Egyptians Babylonians, Indians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but didn't develop a systematic theory.</p>
	<p> A basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical Greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things). Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.</p>
	<p> In the Hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life. Work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early Byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-Egyptian Zosimos of Panopolis. Alchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the Arab world after the Muslim conquests, and from there, and from the Byzantine remnants, diffused into medieval and Renaissance Europe through Latin translations. Some influential Muslim chemists, Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Avicenna and Al-Kindi refuted the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the transmutation of metals; and al-Tusi described a version of the conservation of mass, noting that a body of matter is able to change but is not able to disappear.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Chemistry as science</h3>
	<p> The development of the modern scientific method was slow and arduous, but an early scientific method for chemistry began emerging among early Muslim chemists, beginning with the 9th century Persian or Arabian chemist Jābir ibn Hayyān (known as "Geber" in Europe), who is sometimes referred to as "the father of chemistry". He introduced a systematic and experimental approach to scientific research based in the laboratory, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were largely allegorical and often unintelligble. Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. Boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text The Sceptical Chymist where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry. He formulated Boyle's law, rejected the classical "four elements" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.</p>
	<p> The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.</p>
	<p> Before his work, though, many important discoveries had been made, specifically relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases. The Scottish chemist Joseph Black (the first experimental chemist) and the Dutchman J. B. van Helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what Black called 'fixed air' in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated pure oxygen.</p>
	<p> English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.</p>
	<p> The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, J. J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.</p>
	<p> British William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J. A. R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements in the 1860s by Dmitri Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including Julius Lothar Meyer. The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.</p>
	<p> Organic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, reducible to chemistry. Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Chemical structure</h3>
	<p> At the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms. In 1897, J. J. Thomson of Cambridge University discovered the electron and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and Marie Curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity. In a series of pioneering scattering experiments Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.</p>
	<p> His work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and Henry Moseley. The electronic theory of chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed by the American scientists Linus Pauling and Gilbert N. Lewis.</p>
	<p> The year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Year of Chemistry. It was an initiative of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Principles of modern chemistry</h4>
	<p> The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model. Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. This matter can be studied in solid, liquid, or gas states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.</p>
	<p> The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.</p>
	<p> A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.</p>
	<p> Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists. Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Matter</h3>
	<p> In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well - not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Atom</h2>
	<p> The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space called the electron cloud. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.</p>
	<p> The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Element</h2>
	<p> A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol Z. The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.</p>
	<p> The standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Compound</h2>
	<p> A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements. The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system. The names for Inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system. When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components. In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Molecule</h2>
	<p> A molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.</p>
	<p> Thus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, giving the "molecule" a charge, the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered "molecules" in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.</p>
	<p> he "inert" or noble gas elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way. Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.</p>
	<p> However, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules. These other types of substances, such as ionic compounds and network solids, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se. Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance. Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite.</p>
	<p> One of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Substance and mixture</h2>
	<p> A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties. A collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of mixtures are air and alloys.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Mole and amount of substance</h2>
	<p> The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount). The mole is defined as the number of atoms found in exactly 0.012 kilogram (or 12 grams) of carbon-12, where the carbon-12 atoms are unbound, at rest and in their ground state. The number of entities per mole is known as the Avogadro constant, and is determined empirically to be approximately 6.022×1023 mol−1. Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in moldm−3.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Phase</h2>
	<p> In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as pressure or temperature.</p>
	<p> Physical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.</p>
	<p> Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.</p>
	<p> The most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).</p>
	<p> Less familiar phases include plasmas, Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Bonding</h2>
	<p> Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them. More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.</p>
	<p> A chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.</p>
	<p> An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.</p>
	<p> In a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom. Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule. However, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.</p>
	<p> Similarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Energy</h2>
	<p> In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.</p>
	<p> A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.</p>
	<p> Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor - that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound</p>
	<p> A related concept free energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical thermodynamics. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the Gibbs free energy is negative, {\displaystyle \Delta G\leq 0\,}  \Delta G \le 0 \,; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium.</p>
	<p> There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.</p>
	<p> The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds. Whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions.</p>
	<p> The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.</p>
	<p> The existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g. IR, microwave, NMR, ESR, etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects - like stars and distant galaxies - by analyzing their radiation spectra.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Reaction</h2>
	<p> When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. A chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the "reaction" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.</p>
	<p> Chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. Oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid-base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.</p>
	<p> A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.</p>
	<p> The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.</p>
	<p> According to the IUPAC gold book, a chemical reaction is "a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species." Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ions and salts</h3>
	<p> An ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation. When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion. Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts, such as the Na+ and Cl− ions forming sodium chloride, or NaCl. Examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid-base reactions are hydroxide (OH−) and phosphate (PO43−).</p>
	<p> Plasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Acidity and basicity</h3>
	<p> A substance can often be classified as an acid or a base. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is Arrhenius theory, which states than an acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. According to Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.</p>
	<p> A third common theory is Lewis acid-base theory, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. According to this theory, the crucial things being exchanged are charges. There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.</p>
	<p> Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is pH, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and can be said to be more acidic. The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the acid dissociation constant (Ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid. That is, substances with a higher Ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower Ka values.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Redox</h3>
	<p> Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers.</p>
	<p> A reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself. And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Equilibrium</h3>
	<p> Although the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.</p>
	<p> A system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not static; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Chemical laws</h3>
	<p> Chemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry.</p>`

	<p> Colony : This word refers to the movement of a people, or a portion of a people, from one country to another.</p>
	<p> These migrations have been frequent across the earth but they have often had different causes and effects. In order to distinguish them, we have organized them into six kinds of colonies each of which we will characterize.</p>
	<p> I. About 350 years after the flood, the human race formed but a single family. After Noah's death, his descendants, having grown too numerous to live together, separated from each other. The offspring of each of Noah's sons, Japheth, Shem and Ham, divided into different tribes, left the Shinar plain to look for new homes; each tribe became a different nation. In this way, the different regions of the world were populated little by little, as each came to the point when it could no longer feed its inhabitants.</p>
	<p> This was the first sort of colony : need brought it about, and its consequence was the subdivision of tribes or nations.</p>
	<p> II. Even when men were spread across the entire surface of the earth, each region was not populated so much that new residents could not find space to share with existing inhabitants.</p>
	<p> As populations grew distant from the common center where all the nations had originated, each separate family wandered according to its own whim, without having a fixed residence. However, in the regions where a larger number of men had remained, they ultimately created societies, as a result of the natural sentiment which prompts men to come together and their awareness of their reciprocal needs. Ambition, violence, war and even natural population increase then led members of these societies to look for new places to live.</p>
	<p> It was thus that Inachus, originally from Phoenicia, came to found the kingdom of Argos in Greece. His descendants there were later stripped of this inheritance by Danaus, another adventurer who had come from Egypt. Cadmus, not daring to reappear in front of his father Agenor, king of Tyre, journeyed to the borders of Phocida, and there erected the foundations of the city of Thebes. Cecrops, the leader of an Egyptian colony , built that city which, under the name of Athens , became the temple of the Arts and Sciences. Africa was not alarmed at seeing rise the walls of Carthage, that would soon turn it into a tributary state. Italy welcomed the Trojans who escaped from the destruction of their homeland. These new inhabitants brought their laws and their artisanal skills into the regions where fortune brought them. But they formed only small societies, which almost always became republics.</p>
	<p> The increased population of citizens in a bounded or mostly unfertile territory endangered liberty: politics remedied this by establishing colonies. The very loss of liberty, revolutions, and factions sometimes spurred a portion of the people to leave their native land to form a new society more compatible with their own spirit.</p>
	<p> This was among other reasons the origin of most of the colonies of the Greeks in Asia, Sicily, Rome, and the land of the Gauls. Conquest and expansion were not their goals at all; while normally each colony kept the laws, religion and language of the metropole, it was free, and depended on its founders only because of bonds of gratitude, or because it needed a common defense. On some occasions, though admittedly quite rare, a colony and a metropole could even be armed against each other.</p>
	<p> This second type of colonies had diverse motives; but they shared a common effect: multiplying independent societies among the nations, increasing communication among them, and refining them.</p>
	<p> III. From the time that the earth had so many inhabitants that it became necessary to institute private property, this property created disputes among them. Disputes between members of a society were adjudicated by laws, but they could not be between independent societies. In that case, force ruled; the weakness of the defeated was the basis of a second usurpation, and was the mark of the victors' success. Men became obsessed with the spirit of conquest.</p>
	<p> The victor, to secure his borders, dispersed the vanquished among the lands he controlled, and distributed their properties to his own subjects. Alternatively, he was sometimes content with building and fortifying new cities, which he populated with soldiers and citizens from his own state.</p>
	<p> This is the third kind of colonies, of which almost all ancient histories offer some examples, especially those of the great states. It is through such colonies that Alexander assumed control over the multitude of peoples he had conquered so rapidly. The Romans, from the beginning of their republic, also used this method to expand, and at the height of their empire, these were the barriers that protected the Romans from the Parthians and the Nordic peoples. This type of colony was the result of conquest, and also provided its security.</p>
	<p> IV. The excursions of the Gauls into Italy, along with those of the Goths and Vandals throughout Europe and Africa, and the Tartars into China, constitute a fourth kind of colony. These peoples, forced from their lands by more powerful peoples or by destitution, or attracted by knowledge of a better climate and a more fertile terrain elsewhere, conquered in order to share the new lands with the peoples they conquered and join with them in a single nation. In this they were very different from other conquerors, such as the Scythians in Asia, who seemed only to be seeking new enemies; or from the founders of the four great empires, who wanted to extend their borders.</p>
	<p> The effect of these colonies of barbarians in the regions where they settled was to scare away the Arts and spread ignorance. At the same time, however, they increased the population and established powerful monarchies.</p>
	<p> V. The fifth type of colonies includes those that are founded in the spirit of commerce and enrich the metropole.</p>
	<p> Tyre, Carthage and Marseille, the only cities in antiquity that based their power on trade, were also the only ones who followed this plan in some of their colonies. Utica, built by the Tyrians nearly 200 years before the flight of Elissa (more commonly known as Dido), never made claims to an empire on the shores of Africa; it served only as a place of retreat for Tyrian ships. The same was true for the colonies established in Malta and along the coasts by the Phoenicians. Cadiz, one of their oldest and most famous colonies , made a claim only for trade with Spain, without undertaking to give it new laws. The founding of Lilibeo in Sicily did not at all prompt the Tyrians to think about conquering this island.</p>
	<p> Commerce was not the reason for the founding of Carthage, but it still sought to expand itself through trade. It was only in order to expand or maintain trade that the city went to war, and that we see it fighting with Rome over Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, Italy and even its own walls. Its colonies along the coasts of Africa, and on both seas as far as Cerne [Madagascar], added more to its wealth than did its power as an empire.</p>
	<p> Marseille, a colony of the Phoceans chased from their country and then from Corsica by the Tyrians, occupied itself with nothing in this sterile territory but fishing, trade, and its own independence. Its colonies in Spain and on the southern coasts of the Gallic regions had no other motives.</p>
	<p> These types of settlements were doubly necessary for peoples who devoted themselves to trade. Their navigation, done without the aid of a compass, was timid; they did not dare to go too far from the coasts, and the inevitable length of voyages made safe and numerous places of retreat necessary for navigators. Most peoples with whom these nations traded either refrained from city life, or, busy only with satisfying their needs, placed no value on superfluities. It was necessary to establish depots for internal commerce, and to provide a place where arriving vessels could exchange their wares.</p>
	<p> The form of these colonies resembled those of the commercial nations of Europe in Africa and India: these have trading posts and fortresses there for the convenience and security of their trade. If they were to become conquerors, these colonies would depart from their original purpose, unless the colonizing country took charge of their expenses. they must be dependant on a wealthy charter company with monopoly rights and the ability to create and maintain diplomatic agreements. In India, among all the great nations of Europe who trade there, only the English are viewed as merchants — undoubtedly, because they have the least extensive land-holdings there.</p>
	<p> VI. The discovery of America towards the end of the fifteenth century has multiplied European colonies , and offers us a sixth type.</p>
	<p> All those on this continent were either founded with an eye towards both commerce and agriculture, or have eventually moved in this direction. On this basis, these colonies required the conquering of territory and the driving out of existing inhabitants, in order to import new ones.</p>
	<p> Since these colonies have been established only for the needs of the metropole, it follows:</p>
	<p> 1. That they must be directly dependent upon it, and consequently under its protection.</p>
	<p> 2. That the founders of the colony must have a monopoly on trade there.</p>
	<p> Such a colony best fulfills its purpose when it adds to what is grown in the metropole, when it supports a greater number of its men, and when it increases trade with other nations. These three advantages might not always coexist in each colony , but one of the three at least needs to be substantial enough to compensate for the others. If the compensation is not complete, or if the colony does not provide any of the above advantages, one might determine that it is ruinous for the mother country and is burdensome to it.</p>
	<p> Thus, the profit derived from the trade and cultivation of our colonies is precisely: 1. the greatest income which their consumption provides to the owner of our lands, minus the costs of cultivation; 2. what our artisans and sailors earn from their work for them and through them; 3. everything we need which they provide; 4. the total surplus which they give us to export.</p>
	<p> From this calculation, several things follow:</p>
	<p> The first is that colonies would no longer be useful if they could do without the metropole. Thus, it is a law inherent in the nature of the system that one must limit the arts and cultivation in a colony to certain objects, according to the convenience of the colonizing country.</p>
	<p> The second consequence is that if the colony undertakes trade with foreigners, or consumes foreign goods, the amount of this trade and these goods is like a theft against the metropole — a theft only too common, but punishable by the laws, and by means of which the real and relative power of a state is diminished by whatever foreigners gain.</p>
	<p> It is thus not at all a violation of freedom of trade to restrict commerce in this case. Indeed, any regime that tolerates it by its indifference, or that allows certain ports to violate the first principle of the institution of colonies — is a regime destructive of commerce or of the wealth of a nation.</p>
	<p> The third consequence is that a colony will be even more useful the more it is populated, and the more its land is under cultivation.</p>
	<p> In order for this to happen, the first settlement must be financed by the state that founds it; estates must be divided equally among the children, so that the distribution of family fortunes can support a greater number of inhabitants; and commercial competition must be firmly established, because the ambitions of merchants will lead them to offer more loans to farmers against their crops than the companies would, being monopolistic and consequently in a position to dictate the price of goods as well as the term of payments. The lot of the colonists must also be very easy, to compensate for their labors and their loyalty. This is the reason why clever nations draw no more from their colonies than they need for the maintenance of fortresses and garrisons. Sometimes they are even satisfied with the general profits generated from trade.</p>
	<p> A state's expenses on its colonies are not limited to the first costs of setting them up. These types of ventures require steadfastness, stubbornness even, unless the nation's ambition is supplemented by extraordinary efforts. But steadfastness produces more certain results and more solid principles. Therefore, until commerce has increased enough to provide stability for the colonies , they need continual encouragement, according to their location and the quality of their soil. If they are neglected, beyond losing the benefits of all the work and money that has gone into them already, they also risk becoming the prey of more ambitious or more active peoples.</p>
	<p> It would however go against the very purpose of colonies if establishing them meant depopulating the colonizing country. Intelligent nations only send little by little their surplus population, or those who are a burden on society. Thus, optimum size of the initial population is the number of settlers necessary to defend the canton against enemies who might attack it. Subsequent groups serve to increase trade. The excess of population would be the quantity of useless men found there, or the number of men the colonizing country has need of. Circumstances may thus arise in which it would be useful to prevent citizens from the metropole from deciding on their own to emigrate, either to all the colonies in general, or to one colony in particular.</p>
	<p> Because the colonies in America established a new kind of dependency and trade, it was necessary to make new laws for them. Clever legislators have aimed primarily to promote settlement and farming there. But as both reach a certain level of success, these laws may end up working against their original purpose, which is trade. In this case, these laws are in fact unjust, because it is trade that makes colonies flourish. It would thus seem appropriate to change or modify them as they depart from their original intention. If agriculture was once favored more than trade, that was only to help trade itself. Once the reasons for this preferential treatment have ended, the balance must be reestablished.</p>
	<p> When a state has multiple colonies that can communicate amongst themselves, the true secret to increasing the power and wealth of each one is establishing regular navigation and communication routes between them. This private trade has the same power and benefits as the domestic commerce within a state, provided that colonial commodities are never of the sort which will compete with those of the metropole. Wealth will actually increase by this means, since the ease and comfort of the colonies will be returned to it as a benefit as a result of the consumption that it makes possible. For the same reason, trade that they pursue with the colonies of foreign countries in commodities needed for their own consumption is also advantageous, if it is contained within appropriate limits.</p>
	<p> Commerce within and between colonies is subject to general principles that make it flourish everywhere. However, there are particular circumstances that can require deviation from these principles. Everything must change over time, and supreme skill consists of taking advantage of these forced adjustments.</p>
	<p> We have seen that, in general, liberty must be restricted in favor of the metropole. Another constant principle is that every monopoly granted, and everything that deprives merchants and residents of profits and competition, and of tolls and easements, has even more pernicious effects in a colony than anywhere else. This is because commerce is so restrained there, that the effect of these is more pronounced; discouragement there is followed by complete abandonment. Even when these effects are not immediate, it is certain that the harm they cause will only be more dangerous.</p>
	<p> Anything which helps to decrease the quantity of a colonial product or to increase its price necessarily decreases the profit to the metropole, and allows other nations a chance to gain control of the market, or to compete with it.</p>
	<p> We will not go into detail here on the various European colonies in America, in Africa, and in the East Indies, so as not to make this article too long; besides, the natural place for these subjects is as part of the discussion of the trade of each state.</p>`,

	<p> In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign.[vague] For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception.</p>
	<p> The metropolitan state is the state that rules the colony. In Ancient Greece, the city that founded a colony was known as the metropolis. "Mother country" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p> Unlike a puppet state or satellite state, a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.</p>
	<p> The term informal colony is used by some historians to refer to a country under the de facto control of another state, although this term is often contentious.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Definitions</h4>
	<p> The word "colony" comes from the Latin word colōnia. This in turn derives from the word colōnus, which means colonist but also implies a farmer. Cologne is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman colonia include cities from Belgrade to York. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman Colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.[4] The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head capital, which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin word caput, meaning 'head'). So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.</p>
	<p> Roman colonies first appeared when the Romans conquered neighbouring Italic peoples. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory. Its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a central region to an outlying one became the modern definition.</p>

	<p> • French Indochina was formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia; Laos was added after the Franco-Siamese War in 1893. The federation lasted until 1954. In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but in fact gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as figureheads.</p>
	<p> • Ghana: Contact between Europe and Ghana (known as The Gold Coast) began in the 15th century with the arrival of the Portuguese. This soon led to the establishment of several colonies by European powers: Portuguese Gold Coast (1482–1642), Dutch Gold Coast (1598-1872), Swedish Gold Coast (1650-1663), Danish Gold Coast (1658-1850), Brandenburger and Prussian Gold Coast (1685-1721) and British Gold Coast (1821-1957). In 1957, Ghana was the first African colony south of the Sahara to become independent.</p>
	<p> • Greenland was a colony of Denmark-Norway from 1721 and was a colony of Denmark from 1814 to 1953. In 1953 Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979 and extended to self-rule in 2009. See also Danish colonization of the Americas.</p>
	<p> • Guinea-Bissau: a colony of Portugal since the 15th century. Independent since 1974.</p>

	<p> • India Major parts of India were under the direct control of the government of the United Kingdom between 1858 and 1947. After 1947, British India was split into India and Pakistan. See also Crown colony. However Britain was not the only colonial power in India. From the 15th century until 1961, parts of modern India belonged to Portugal and were collectively known as Portuguese India. Other parts (the town of Tharangambadi, Serampore and the Nicobar Islands) belonged to Denmark from 1620 to 1869 and were known as Danish India.</p>
	<p> • Indonesia was a Dutch colony for 350 years, from 1600 to 1949. During World War II, it was occupied by the Japanese military from 1942 to 1945.</p>

	<p> • Liberia was the only African nation on the African continent that was a colony for the United States of America and a protectorate from 1821 until the Liberian Declaration of Independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847. Liberia is Africa's oldest republic nation and the second oldest black republic in the world after Haiti. Liberia was founded, colonized, established and controlled by the American Colonization Society, a private organization who sent freed slaves from America and the Caribbean to Liberia as colonists to settle. Due to its backing and support from the United States, Liberia remained legally independent during the colonial era.</p>
	<p> • South Africa consisted of territories colonies by various different African and European powers, including the Dutch, the British, and the Nguni. The territory consisting the modern nation was ruled directly by the British from 1806-1910, at which point power gradually devolved from London until all remaining legal ties were formally severed in 1961.</p>

	<p> • Philippines, previously a colony of Spain from 1521 to 1898 as part of the Spanish East Indies, was a colony of the United States from 1898 to 1946. Achieved self-governing Commonwealth status in 1935. During World War II between 1942 and 1945, it was occupied by the Japanese forces. Its independence was recognized in 1946.</p>
	<p> • Somalia, was a colony of Italy and Britain from the late 1800s to 1960. On July 6, 1960, the Trust Territory of Somaliland (former Italian Somaliland) united as planned with the former British Somaliland to form the Somali Republic (Somalia).</p>

	<p> • Taiwan had a Dutch colony (1624–1662) centered on present-day Tainan; shortly afterwards, a Spanish colony (1626–1642) was established concurrently in northern Taiwan, not far from present-day Taipei. Chinese colonial rule was established when Han Chinese forces loyal to the Ming Dynasty defeated the Dutch in 1662. The Ming loyalists later surrendered Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty, which annexed Taiwan into Chinese territory, making it part of Fujian province, and later making it a province in its own right. Qing dynasty rule ended after the First Sino-Japanese War when the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan, placing Taiwan under Japanese control (1895-1945). After the defeat of Japan in World War II, Taiwan was given to the Republic of China, becoming its base after its defeat in the Chinese civil war.</p>
	<p> • The  United States was formed from a union of thirteen distinct English/British colonies in British America. The Colony of Virginia was the first of the thirteen colonies. All thirteen declared independence in July 1776 and expelled the British governors.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Current colonies</h4>
	<p> The Special Committee on Decolonization maintains the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies. Given that dependent territories have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state, there is disagreement over the classification of "colony".</p>`

	<p> Copyright, a term in Publishing and bookselling , is the ownership that a publisher exercises over a literary work, whether manuscript or printed, and which he holds from the author himself or from one or more men of letters that the author has authorized or in a case where the work was created and first printed in a foreign country, and the publisher believes that he is the first to print it in his own country. It is called copyright because the author retains, or is presumed to retain, the original of his work and to deliver only a copy of it to the publisher from which to print. The author cedes his rights over his work; the publisher receives only a copy of the work; from this arises the habit of speaking of copyright which means, correctly, the right of ownership of the work. The term was devised to refer to the first case; it was then adopted to refer to the second, to which it is equally applicable: as for the third, it is by extension that one calls copyright the rights that the publisher acquires over a work previous published in a foreign country which he believes he is the first to print in his own country; however, until the present, this extension was justified  by custom. The right was always regarded as incontestable by publishers in all countries; for all that, it has sometimes been contested. In order to give a clear and comprehensible explanation of the right, and in what it consists, we shall describe separately the different ways in which a publisher becomes, or is able to become, the owner of a literary work. We shall also describe the privileges that sovereigns award for the printing of books because those who have contested the copyright of publishers have sometimes based their attacks on the limited duration of these privileges.</p>
    <p> The publisher’s rights that he holds from the author over a literary work are the same as the author’s rights over his own work and these seem to be incontestable. If there is on earth any state of freedom it is assuredly that of men of letters: if Nature contains anything whose ownership cannot be disputed with those who possess it, it must be these products of the mind. For about a hundred years after the invention of printing all authors or their appointed representatives in France were free to print without the need to obtain any authorisation; there were abuses  and, to remedy these, our kings established laws to govern printing with the object of maintaining unsullied in the kingdom religion, customs and public peace. These laws require that any work to be printed must carry approval and a licence or privilege from the king see Approval, Censor, Registration of printing privileges, Privilege (Printing Privilege; Privilege, Printing). The Approval is purely regulatory, the Privilege is a act both of justice and of protection by which the sovereign guarantees the right of printing and sale of a work to its the owner and forbids it to all others within his realms. This exclusion is no doubt an act of grace from the prince but it changes nothing about the nature of ownership: on the contrary it is founded on the justice of putting the  proprietor in a position to reap the fruits of his labour and his outlay.</p>
    <p> But rulers who are the source of privileges do not in any way claim rights over literary works which are still unpublished; they have made no edict that threatens to despoil authors of their ownership and paternity whether their works were still manuscripts in the authors’ hands, or were made public by printing; thus men of letters have remained, as they were before the introduction of privileges, indisputable owners of their manuscript or printed works as long as they have neither ceded nor sold their rights. Thus the author is in a position to dispose of his rights like any other of his effects, and he can do this by transferring them to a publisher either as a free gift, or by sale. Whether he gives them or sells them, if he transmits all his rights of ownership for all time, if he disposes of them in perpetuity in favour of the publisher, the latter becomes as incontestably the owner, and with the same scope, as if he were the author himself. The ownership of a work of a literary work, that is the right to reprint it when necessary, is thus an item of commerce, like a piece of land, a rent or a house it passes from fathers to children, and from one publisher to another, by inheritance, sale, or by being ceded or exchanged; and the rights of the latest owner are as incontestable as those of the first. However, there have been literary men who have contested this and have claimed to recover rights over their work after having sold them in perpetuity; but these claims have been unsuccessful so far. They have been founded particularly on the fact that sovereigns grant privileges only for a limited time claiming that this is to reserve the right, on the expiry of the privilege, to award it to whomsoever they wish; but they are mistaken, princes cannot give anyone property that they do not own and the fixed term of privileges has other purposes. By fixing a term princes wish to reserve to themselves the right not to renew permission to print a work, if, for reasons of state, they do not wish at one time to allow principles or propositions that they were willing to permit at another time. The grant or refusal of permission to allow a book to be printed or reprinted is purely a matter of regulation within the state and it is very wise indeed that it should depend only on the will of the prince: but his justice would not allow him, on the expiry of a privilege that could be renewed, to refuse it to the work’s owner but grant it to someone else. In addition, in fixing a term for the exclusion that forms part of the privilege, which is a grace, princes wish to force the owners  to fulfil the conditions of the award; and these conditions are to correct the impressions and to make such improvements as are convenient and possible. From this it follows that it is not in the privilege that resides the rights of the publisher, as some people appear to have believed, but in the transfer of the rights from the author.</p>
    <p> For the rest, however solidly these principles of the rights of the publisher that he holds from the author over a literary work may be established, it is true nevertheless that, although the author is no longer the owner, he retains throughout his life a sort of right of inspection and of paternity of his work so that, for the sake of his reputation, he must be allowed to make whatever corrections he believes are required whenever the work is reprinted. This is just and reasonable and the publisher should not refuse it. It may happen that the author’s additions are so considerable that they become almost a new work: if so, it is honest practice to draw up new agreements between the author and the publisher if the latter requires it. But if they were not to succeed in coming to an agreement, the author, unless there is an existing agreement otherwise, would remain owner of his additions and the publisher would continue to own the material that had been ceded to him in the past.</p>
    <p> Perhaps there would be a means of avoiding conflicts that might arise in the future between authors and publishers about literary works when the one sells and the other buys . This would involve the author, when this was his intention, including in the act ceding the rights to the publisher that he sells and cedes in perpetuity his work and his rights of ownership and renounces the rights without restriction. If, on the other hand, he intends only to sell or cede the rights for a certain period he would specify the period as for the duration of the privilege or the course of so many editions etc. It would be wise also to deal with the possibility that the author might in future make additions and so there would not remain any point of doubt which might give rise to conflict; for we must suppose that those which have sometimes arisen can not have had any other cause.</p>
	<p> Publishers also acquire rights of ownership of a work when they have proposed it to one or more men of letters who have agreed to write it either without charge or under agreed conditions. The publisher hold this right from himself and his preparations. We do not know of any occasion when the rights of a publisher under these conditions have ever been contested. But, if some day men of letters who had contributed to such a work were to claim on its completion some right of ownership, their claims would be as little just and legitimate as would those of an architect over a building that he had built. There exist several works of this kind. The largest of this type of work is the present one. By virtue of the work that has been done and the outlays that have been made in order that this Encyclopaedia shall be a new work, then, if not by virtue of the plan itself, at least as a result of its execution, it is certain that it belongs to France by a title more just than England has to Chambers ; for the latter is but a compilation of all our dictionaries.</p>
    <p> Finally, there is a third way in which a publisher can acquire rights of ownership of a literary work; this is by believing that he is the first to print a work in his country which had its origin in a foreign land where it had already been printed. The publisher acquires the rights, as in the foregoing case, as a result of his insight and his industry. In procuring to himself the benefits of a useful work, if his choice is successful, he serves the state and his fellow countrymen first in that he contributes to the output of his country and prevents the money spent on the work from going abroad, and secondly, in that he makes available to the men of letters of his own country, easily and at little cost, works often useful and sometimes essential. On the other hand, for all that this right is quite legitimate in some respects since the publishers of different nations are in the habit of doing each other this kind of wrong, one must admit also that it is contravenes the rights of individuals since it is necessarily damaging to the first publisher. It would be to be desired that all the publishers in Europe would be willing to be equitable enough to respect mutually the rights of other businesses; the public would lose nothing by this and books would pass from one country to another by means of exchanges. But there exist countries in which literary works are not abundant enough and not sufficiently to the taste of other nations to support exchanges between the publishers who inhabit them of all the works they lack. They find it more advantageous to print some of them than to buy them; this is what has prevented until the present, and seems as if it will always prevent, the accord that would be desirable between the publishers of different countries. In the state in which matters lie, this right of ownership founded on being the first to claim it, is as sound as that in the other two cases and is worthy of the same protection from the sovereign, but with this difference; that, with reason, one forbids the entry and distribution of foreign editions of a book into the country of its origin and one ought to allow the introduction of a foreign edition of a book coming from its country of origin whatever printing privilege might have been granted for the printing of the same book in the country in which it arrives. This custom has been established in Holland, and perhaps elsewhere; the Estates General do not refuse a privilege for the printing of a book of French origin but they also do not forbid entry to their country and distribution of editions of the same book coming from France. This should be reciprocated and would be just; it would be a means of lessening the injury done to the first publisher who alone ran all the risks of the enterprise.</p>`,

	<p> Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.</p>
    <p> Copyright is a form of intellectual property, applicable to certain forms of creative work. Some, but not all jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and "moral rights" such as attribution.</p>
	<p> Copyrights are considered territorial rights, which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific jurisdiction. While many aspects of national copyright laws have been standardized through international copyright agreements, copyright laws vary by country.</p>
	<p> Typically, the duration of a copyright spans the author's life plus 50 to 100 years (that is, copyright typically expires 50 to 100 years after the author dies, depending on the jurisdiction). Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, but most recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a civil matter, though some jurisdictions do apply criminal sanctions.</p>
	<p> Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing "fair" exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to copyright law's philosophic basis. Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright, such as those in the music business, have advocated the extension and expansion of copyright and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<h3> Background</h3>
	<p> Copyright came about with the invention of the printing press and with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th century. The English Parliament was concerned about the unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662, which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers' Company, essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.</p>
    <p> Copyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in Europe and not, for example, in Asia. In the Middle Ages in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which capitalism led to the commodification of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per se.</p>
	<p> Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as sound recordings, films, photographs, software, and architectural works.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> National copyrights</h3>
	<p> Often seen as the first real copyright law, the 1709 British Statute of Anne gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired. The act also alluded to individual rights of the artist. It began, "Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors... to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:". A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.</p>
	<p> The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.</p>
	<p> The original length of copyright in the United States was 14 years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the public domain, so it could be used and built upon by others.</p>
	<p> Copyright law was enacted rather late in German states, and the historian Eckhard Höffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> International copyright treaties</h3>
	<p> The 1886 Berne Convention first established recognition of copyrights among sovereign nations, rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for creative works do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention. As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries.The United States did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.
	<p> The United States and most Latin American countries instead entered into the Buenos Aires Convention in 1910, which required a copyright notice on the work (such as all rights reserved), and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms. The Universal Copyright Convention was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the Soviet Union and developing nations.</p>
	<p> The regulations of the Berne Convention are incorporated into the World Trade Organization's TRIPS agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application.</p>
	<p> In 1961, the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property signed the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations. In 1996, this organization was succeeded by the founding of the World Intellectual Property Organization, which launched the 1996 WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty and the 2002 WIPO Copyright Treaty, which enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it. The Trans-Pacific Partnership includes intellectual Property Provisions relating to copyright.</p>
	<p> Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through these international conventions such as the Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and international organizations such as the European Union or World Trade Organization require their member states to comply with them.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Obtaining protection</h4>
	<h3> Ownership</h3>
	<p> The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself if the work is a "work for hire". For example, in English law the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a "Work for Hire". Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the author. But when more than one person creates the work, then a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Eligible works</h3>
	<p> Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Specifics vary by jurisdiction, but these can include poems, theses, fictional characters plays and other literary works, motion pictures, choreography, musical compositions, sound recordings, paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, computer software, radio and television broadcasts, and industrial designs. Graphic designs and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions.</p>
	<p> Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed. For example, the copyright to a Mickey Mouse cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating derivative works based on Disney's particular anthropomorphic mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's. Note additionally that Mickey Mouse is not copyrighted because characters cannot be copyrighted; rather, Steamboat Willie is copyrighted and Mickey Mouse, as a character in that copyrighted work, is afforded protection.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Originality</h3>
	<p> Typically, a work must meet minimal standards of originality in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the United Kingdom there has to be some "skill, labour, and judgment" that has gone into it. In Australia and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a trademark instead.</p>
	<p> Copyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an original creation, rather than based on whether it is unique; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Registration</h3>
	<p> In all countries where the Berne Convention standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights. However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as prima facie evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees. (In the USA, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)</p>
	<p> Copyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an original creation, rather than based on whether it is unique; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Fixing</h3>
	<p> The Berne Convention allows member countries to decide whether creative works must be "fixed" to enjoy copyright. Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: "It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form." Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be "fixed in a tangible medium of expression" to obtain copyright protection. U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be "perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be "expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Copyright notice</h3>
	<p> Before 1989, United States law required the use of a copyright notice, consisting of the copyright symbol (©, the letter C inside a circle), the abbreviation "Copr.", or the word "Copyright", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder. Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a sound recording copyright symbol (℗, the letter P inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter P indicating a "phonorecord". In addition, the phrase All rights reserved was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.</p>
	<p> In 1989 the United States enacted the Berne Convention Implementation Act, amending the 1976 Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic. However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit – using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of "innocent infringement" being successful.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Enforcement</h4>
	<p> Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a civil law court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While central registries are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily prove that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the RIAA are increasingly targeting the file sharing home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court.</p>
	<p> In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.</p>
	<p> "...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Copyright infringement</h3>
	<p> For a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the Berne Convention or WIPO Copyright Treaty. Improper use of materials outside of legislation is deemed "unauthorized edition", not copyright infringement.</p>
	<p> Copyright infringement most often occurs to software, film and music. However, infringement upon books and other text works remains common, especially for educational reasons. Statistics regarding the effects of copyright infringement are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to determine whether there is a monetary loss for industries affected by copyright infringement by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available. Other reports indicate that copyright infringement does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry, and can have a positive effect. In particular, a 2014 university study concluded that free music content, accessed on YouTube, does not necessarily hurt sales, instead has the potential to increase sales.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Rights granted</h4>
	<h3> Exclusive rights</h3>
	<p> Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright:</p>
	<p> • to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)</p>
	<p> • to import or export the work</p>
	<p> • to create derivative works (works that adapt the original work)</p>
	<p> • to perform or display the work publicly</p>
	<p> • to sell or cede these rights to others</p>
	<p> • to transmit or display by radio or video.</p>
	<p> The phrase "exclusive right" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a "negative right", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the unregistered design right in English law and European law. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a philosophical interpretation of copyright law that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a property right or a moral right.</p>
	<p> If a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work is a useful article, it is copyrighted only if its aesthetic features are separable from its utilitarian features. A useful article is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. They must be separable from the functional aspect to be copyrighted.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Duration</h3>
	<p> Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been published, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States and the United Kingdom), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.</p>
	<p> The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.</p>
	<p> In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain. In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain. Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.</p>
	<p> But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.</p>
	<p> In 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Limitations and exceptions</h4>
	<p> In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. It should be noted that US copyright does NOT cover names, title, short phrases or Listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas). However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover – such as trademarks and patents.</p>
	<p> There are some exceptions to what copyright will protect. Copyright will not protect:</p>
	<p> • Names of products</p>
	<p> • Names of businesses, organizations, or groups</p>
	<p> • Pseudonyms of individuals</p>
	<p> • Titles of works</p>
	<p> • Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes, slogans, or short advertising expressions</p>
	<p> • Listings of ingredients in recipes, labels, and formulas, though the directions can be copyrighted</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Idea–expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine</h3>
	<p> The idea–expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of Baker v. Selden, has since been codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights</h3>
	<p> Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or CD. In the United States this is known as the first-sale doctrine, and was established by the courts to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand bookstores.</p>
	<p> Some countries may have parallel importation restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the aftermarket. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as exhaustion of rights in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to patent and trademark rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.</p>
	<p> In Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in 2013, the United States Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.</p>
	<p> In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement moral rights, a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Fair use and fair dealing</h3>
	<p> Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the fair use doctrine, codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:</p>
	<p> 1. the purpose and character of one's use</p>
	<p> 2. the nature of the copyrighted work</p>
	<p> 3. what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and</p>
	<p> 4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</p>
	<p> In the United Kingdom and many other Commonwealth countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the courts or through legislation. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in Canada, private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 SCC 37, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. legal advice). Under current Australian law, although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to “format shift” that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to “time shift” a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.</p>
	<p> In the United States the AHRA (Audio Home Recording Act Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.</p>
	<p> Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions </p>
	<p> No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.</p>
	<p> Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner. An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.</p>
	<p> The copyright directive allows EU member states to implement a set of exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:</p>
	<p> • photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,</p>
	<p> • reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial</p>
	<p> • archival reproductions of broadcasts,</p>
	<p> • uses for the benefit of people with a disability,</p>
	<p> • for demonstration or repair of equipment,</p>
	<p> • for non-commercial research or private study</p>
	<p> • when used in parody</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Accessible copies</h3>
	<p> It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Transfer, assignment and licensing</h4>
	<p> A copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another. For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the Internet; however, the record industry attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.</p>
	<p> A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective, for example under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under U.S. law. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a real estate transaction.</p>
	<p> Copyright may also be licensed. Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed statutory license (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a compulsory license, because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made. Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, copyright collectives or collecting societies and performing rights organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Free licences</h3>
	<p> Copyright licenses known as open or free licenses seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not, to an effect inspired by the public domain. Free in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the Free Software Definition, the Debian Free Software Guidelines, the Open Source Definition and the Definition of Free Cultural Works. Further refinements to these licenses have resulted in categories such as copyleft and permissive. Common examples of free licences are the GNU General Public License, BSD licenses and some Creative Commons licenses.</p>
	<p> Founded in 2001 by James Boyle, Lawrence Lessig, and Hal Abelson, the Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, gratis. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.</p>
	<p> Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work. As of 2009 approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Criticism</h4>
	<p> Some sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over copynorms. Particularly on the internet, there is discussion about the copyright aspects of downloading and streaming, the copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing. Such concerns are often couched in the language of digital rights and database rights. Discussions include Free Culture, a 2004 book by Lawrence Lessig. Lessig coined the term permission culture to describe a worst-case system. Good Copy Bad Copy (documentary) and RiP!: A Remix Manifesto, discuss copyright. Some suggest an alternative compensation system.</p>
	<p> Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an anti-copyright stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate ignoring legal statutes when on the web.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Public domain</h4>
	<p> Copyright, like other intellectual property rights, is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be freely used or exploited by anyone. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a common law copyright. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the internet, for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Cosmology (Encyclopedic order. Understanding. Reason. Philosophy or Science. Science of nature. Cosmology). This word is formed by the combination of two Greek words, κόσμος, world, and λόγος, speech, which signifies the science which speaks of the world; that is to say the reason concerning the world in which we live and such as it actually exists. It is in this way which it differs from Cosmography and Cosmogony. See these words.</p>
	<p> Cosmology is properly defined as a part of general Physics, which by avoiding a too detailed explanation of the facts examines the metaphysical results of these same facts and attempts to provide analogies and connections that they have between them and tries to discover the parts of the general laws by which the Universe is governed. Everything is linked in nature; all beings are connected by a continuous chain in which we sometimes see the continuous parts, even though there are a greater number of places in which the continuity escapes us. The art of the philosopher does not consist, as it all too often happens, of forcing estranged parties together by inappropriately re-forging connections which are unfortunately broken in certain places; since through those efforts one can only keep the parties separate which were joined or to keep those who should be in contact even further from those who wished to be closer. Thus the art of the Philosopher consists of offering more links to those separated parties so as to have them at the least distance possible, but he should not flatter himself that there will no longer be any empty space in places. So as to build these links that we speak of, it is necessary to take notice of two things: the observed facts surrounding the composition of these links and to the general laws of nature which form the bond. I have termed them general laws since they are the ones which are observable in a large number of phenomenon, and I am cautious not to say in all . These are the laws of motion which a series are outlining the imperviousness of a body and the source of many effects that we observe in nature. Shape and motion (I understand that motion comes from impulsion), these are a large part of the principles on which Cosmology is established. One should not stray without necessity neither should one say that these are the only one: we do not have all the facts, how could we establish the fact that they can be explained through one unique law? This assumption would be all the more reckless since amongst the facts that we do know is the fact that the laws of force have not been thoroughly explained to this day. See Attraction. Perhaps one day we will achieve this, but while waiting for that day let us suspend our judgment of the universality of these laws. Perhaps (and this is possibly true) there is a general law which is and will always be unknown, one for which we only see particular consequences both obscure and limited that prohibit us from calling them general laws. This conjecture fits very nicely into the idea that we should have concerning nature's unity and simplicity. See Nature. In the end if we reflect on the weakness of our character, we will be all the more surprised by what we have discovered and what still remains hidden.</p>
	<p> However the principal use that we should have obtained from Cosmology is to be able to raise ourselves from the authorship of the general laws of nature whose wisdom established these laws and who has allowed us to see what is necessary for our use or enjoyment and to have hidden the rest so as to teach us the use of doubt. Thus Cosmology as the science of the World or the Universe which is generally considered to be composed simply by the union and harmony of its parts; a complete whole which is governed by a supreme intelligence who winds the springs, puts the game in motion, all of which is handled by this intelligence.</p>
	<p> Before Mr. Wolf, Mr. Formey informed us in an article that this noun was unknown in school, that is to say there was no distinct course in Philosophy that was designed as such. No Metaphysician had apparently even thought of this topic and as many volumes as had been written on Metaphysics said nothing on Cosmology. Finally, Mr. Wolf has provided us a work with the title: Cosomologia generalis, methodo scientifica pertractata, qua ad solidam, imprimis Dei ataque naturae, cognitionem via sternitur. Francof. & Lips. In quarto 1731. There was a new edition in 1737. He provided this work immediately after Ontology and a second part of his metaphysics since he established principles which serve to identify theologically the existence and attributes of God contingent on the universe and through the order of Nature. He calls it General or Transcendental Cosmology since it is an abstract theory in relation to Physics as Ontology is to the rest of Philosophy.</p>
	<p> The basis for this science is derived from Ontology because it requires that one apply to the world the general theory of being and of composed things. This is an a priori determination of the world into which one can add observations and experience. It is in such a way that one can say that there is a double Cosmology ; scientific Cosmology and experimental Cosmology .</p>
	<p> Of these two Cosmologies , Mr. Wolf has limited himself to the former as the title of his work indicates; however he has not neglected the help that experience by providing for the confirmation of his principles.</p>
	<p> The one and the other provide principles which serve to promote the existence and the qualities of God. The principal subjects that general Cosmology embraces are reduced to explain how the world is the result of an assembly of simple substances and develop the general principles concerning the changes which occur in material things.</p>
	<p> Here is the precious fruit which Cosmology bears; nothing more is required to have the prize but to cultivate it for it produces no other fruit but this one. It is in this way that we can show that the contemplation of the visible world leads us to the knowledge of that invisible being who is its author. Mr. Wolf appears extremely persuaded of the utility and the certainty of this new path that he has cleared and this is what he says about it:</p>
	<p> In honorem Dei, confiteri cogor, me de cognitione Dei methodo scientifica tradenda plurium sollicitum, non reperisse viam aliam, qua ad scopum perveniri datuir, quam eam quam proposition praesens monstrat, nec reperisse philosophum qui eandem rite calvalerit, etsi laude sita defraunandi non sint, qui nostris proesertim temporibus theologiae naturali methodum demonstrativam applicare conati fuerint. Wolf Cosmolog. Prolegom. 6. in schol .</p>
	<p> A few years ago Mr. de Maupertuis provided us with an essay on Cosmology which appears to have followed the principles and points of view from the work that we mentioned above. He is of the impression that we do not have sufficient facts or principles to embrace the fullness of Nature with one point of view. He attempts to explain a Universal system and to propose the general laws that govern it by extracting a new proof of the existence of God. This work elicited a very hostile reaction in 1752 and I shall introduce some thoughts which may help to better explain the subject. I will be as short as possible and I hope to remain impartial.</p>
	<p> Mr. de Maupertuis provided us with a general law concerning the principle of least action, See in the definition and the explanation of the word Action to which we will add the following remarks.</p>
	<p> Leibniz had formed a particular idea concerning the force exerted on bodies in motion, and of which the word Force [Force (Grammar. Literature), Force (Iconology), Conservation of Kinetic Energy, Force of Inertia, Kinetic Energy, Force, Resulting force, Force of motion, Moving force, Force of Water (Hydraulics)] is used, and he named it force vive and assumed that it was the product of mass multiplied by the square of the speed or that it was the square of the speed taking the mass as a unit, which comes to the same thing. In the Saint Petersburg Mémoires, Volume I, Mr. Wolf had suggested to multiply the force vive (kinetic energy) by time and he called this product action (kinetic energy), supposing that the action of a body is the result of all forces that it exerts at every instant and consequentially the sum of all instantaneous live forces. One might ask of the Leibnizians, of which Mr. Wolf is regarded as the their spokesman, why they have imagined this metaphysical distinction between action and kinetic energy, a distinction that they perhaps should not have placed in between, due to the formulation of their idea regarding the kinetic energy, however this is not what we are speaking about, instead we should be speaking of the word Force [Force (Grammar. Literature), Force (Iconology), Conservation of Kinetic Energy, Force of Inertia, Kinetic Energy, Force, Resulting force, Force of motion, Moving force, Force of Water (Hydraulics)]. While waiting to allow an arbitrary title for the idea of action as a definition, we must remark that it is the same as that of Mr. de Maupertuis in the works that we have already quoted, as the word Action does not tell us if he had knowledge of Mr. Wolf's definition. It does not appear to be so as we ignore who wrote this last article and we wish to be scrupulously accurate and provide those to whom the information belongs. In the end it really does not matter that Mr. de Maupertuis has taken this idea from Mr. Wolf or that he met with him, since it is uniquely confined to the consequences that he was able to extract ones from which Mr. Wolf had absolutely no part. Mr. de Maupertuis has always been the first to have noted in refraction that the quantity of action is a minimum and that it is no less constant.</p>
	<p> 1. That this principle is different from the one stated here that; Nature always acts in the most direct path , since this latter principle has a nebulous definition which can have a hundred different applications according to whatever definition that we would wish to give to it which we see as Nature's simplest path, and that is to say whatever we would wish it to be when considering Nature's simplest and shortest path it would take or is it a straight line, that is to say the shortest distance or in the least amount of time, or with the minimum amount of motion, or with the least amount of kinetic energy or in that of action, etc. The principle as endorsed by Mr. de Maupertuis is not a principle which is vaguely outlined, but rather a precise explanation of what he believes to be the path of least resistance taken by nature.</p>
	<p> 2. We have seen that this principle is very different from that of Leibniz, See Action. It would be very unusual if Leibniz had knowledge of Mr. de Maupertuis' principle as it has been said, and that this philosopher had not thought of applying it to refraction; but we will treat this question later.</p>
	<p> 3. It is no less true that Mr. de Maupertuis' principle when applied to refraction reconciles the end causes with the mechanics of least action which is something that no one had done until then. The interest in placing these together is dependent more or less on how much interest was placed on final causes; see this word. The Leibnizians at any rate should be very pleased. In addition, Mr. Euler has demonstrated that this principle occurs in curves which are described by a body when it is either attracted or pushed towards a fixed point. This beautiful proposition extends Mr. de Maupertuis' principle to the small curve that is described by a ray of light which passes from one medium into another. In this way the principle is generally true and has no restrictions. In the Mémoires of the Prussian Academy of Sciences of 1751, Mr. Euler has shown many other cases where the principle applies itself with elegance and ease.</p>
	<p> 4. This principle differs from that in which kinetic energy is nil, for two reasons; because in Mr. de Maupertuis' principle it is not that it is nil but rather minimis and in addition, it is into that action that one introduces the element of time which is not part of kinetic energy. It is not due to the fact that the principle of kinetic energy takes place in other instances and it is not only that it is not possible to take out certain things that one can extract from minimis of action. However, this does not prove the identity of either principle, since one can achieve the same results by different paths.</p>
	<p> 5. We have seen in the article Final causes that the principle of minimum time is not available when considering reflection with concave mirrors. It appears to be the same concerning minimum action, since then the light ray is a maximum and action is also a maximum. It is true that we might seek the square of this principle by always returning the reflection to plane surfaces but perhaps those opposed to Final causes will not appreciate this answer ; and it appears better to say that the action here is at a maximum and in the other cases a minimum. There would be no less merit to have applied the first principle to refraction and it will be similar to the conservation of kinetic energy which applies to the impact of elastic bodies but which does not happen when inelastic bodies collide.</p>
	<p> 6. Mr. de Maupertuis has applied this same law of minimum action to the impact on bodies and he was the first to determine with the same principle the laws of impact of inelastic and elastic bodies. It is true that the application is a little more complicated, more torturous, less simple and perhaps less rigorous than in the case of refraction.</p>
	<p> What we are about to say will not, in the end, be to Mr. de Maupertuis' disadvantage after it has been fully explained. It supposes that two rigid bodies A, B , are in motion in the same direction one at velocity a , the other at velocity b and that their mutual velocities at the point of contact is x ; it is certain he writes that the change which has occurred in Nature is that body A has lost velocity a -x and that body B has increased its velocity to x - b , thus the quantity of action necessary to produce this change must be equal to a minimum which is A (a-x) 2 + B(x-b) 2 which provides the ordinary formula for the collision of rigid bodies [omission: formula; to see consult facsimile version]. All of this is very correct. But everything depends also on the idea that we would wish to attach to the words change which occurs in Nature . Since is it not possible to say that the change occurred in body A prior to the impact as a quantity Axx and the same for body B thus Aaa - Axx is the change which occurs in body B and Bxx -Bbb also the change which occurs in body B .</p>
	<p> In such a way the quantity of action which was responsible for this alteration is Aaa-Axx, Bxx-Bbb . However this quantity which is equal to a minimum does not provide for the law concerning the impact of rigid bodies. It is the one objection that can be made of Mr. de Maupertuis. This criticism was done to a point except with the difference that it was conjectured that Axx+Bxx<-> Aaa-Bbb was equal to a minimum by taking the quantity Aaa-Axx from the quantity Bxx-Bbb instead of adding to it which appears to be something that could have been done since the two quantities Aaa-Axx and Bxx-Bbb should be subtracted from Aaa and the other added to Bbb are real and can be added together irregardless of the direction in which they are acting. Whatever it is, it seems that one should be able to balance or at least to avoid all difficulty in that respect by substituting the words change in the nature which appears in Mr. de Maupertuis' abstract of the proposition of the word change in the velocity, and then at least the ambiguity true or so-called would no longer exist.</p>
	<p> It also appears that in Mr. de Maupertuis' calculations the quantity of action is objected to since it is confused with the quantity of live forces which is to say to a point, since the time which is supposed to be the same as it is here, in these two quantities is proportional to one another and one should say that the quantity of action should never been mistaken for live forces, understanding of course that time, following Mr. de Maupertuis' definition, enters into the quantity of action and in which case of rigid bodies the change occurring in a moment that is indivisible when the time = 0 and consequentially the action is nil. One may respond to this objection that only a body moves or is forced into motion at any velocity and that there is always a real or possible quantity of action which will respond to its motion insofar as it moves uniformly during any time at this velocity; therefore instead of the words, the quantity of action necessary to produce this change one may substitute, the quantity of action that responds to this change and describe in this way Mr. de Maupertuis' rule: The change which occurs to a body's velocity after impact and the quantity of action which will respond to this change, with the time as a constant, is the least possible. It is said the time is a determined constant; this modification and its limitation if we see it this way, is necessary for two reasons: 1. when a collision occurs to rigid bodies where time necessarily = 0, the assumption of constant or variable time is an arbitrary assumption and one must select either one or the other.</p>
	<p> When there is an impact of elastic bodies, the alteration which takes place in a finite amount of time and of very short duration is not the same when all impacts occur, therefore it is imperative to establish the assumption that in effect the time that is assumed constant is a time selected randomly and totally independent of the time during which the motion is conveyed. One should be able to take as the quantity of action the amount used at the moment of change which is a sum of the small quantities of action used during the time that the spring compresses and then releases. One might say that Mr. de Maupertuis should have used the word live force here instead of that of action since time is not appropriate. To that he would have undoubtedly answered that he felt that he could connect this law with a common expression such as with the one he found for refraction. However if we were to substitute live force for action (potential energy for kinetic energy) it would still be true that Mr. de Maupertuis would have been the first to reduce the impact of rigid bodies and those of elastic bodies to a same law which is the main point and his theory of refraction would not have suffer.</p>
	<p> It is true that the laws of motion were found without this principle; however it was useful to have shown how it is applied. It is possibly true that this principle may very well be some other principle presented differently. But this is the case for all mathematical truths, in the end they are merely the transformation of one into another. See Preliminary Discourse, page viij. The principle of the conservation of live forces is in effect the ancient's principle of equilibrium, as I demonstrated in my Dynamique, II part. Chap. And this should not suggest that the principle of the conservation of live forces is not useful but it should also provide honor to its inventors.</p>
	<p> 7. The author continues to apply his principle to equilibrium in the lever, but to do so require certain assumptions, amongst which that velocity is proportional to the distance from the point of impact and that time is constant, as it is in the case of impact of bodies. It must be assumed that the length of the lever is given and that it is the point of application that is being sought, since if the point of application and one arm were known and one were seeking the other, one would find by the principle of action that this arm is equal to zero. In the end the remaining assumptions made by Mr. de Maupertuis are to be allowed and there remains only the necessity to express them so to be out of the critic's reach with all other assumptions expressed. The application and the use of the principle do not contain any more significant generalities. In regards to the assumptions that he gives that gravity is as a mass and that this assumption is provided for by nature itself and it takes place in all the theories concerning the center of gravity of bodies which are regarded as no less general.</p>
	<p> The result of what we have just mentioned is that the principle of least action takes place in a great number of natural phenomenons which applies with great facility to refraction and planetary orbits, as well as a number of others examined by Mr. Euler. See the Mémoires of the Berlin Academy 1751 and the article Action. This principle applies to various other cases with more or less arbitrary modifications however it is one that is always useful in mechanics and one which can facilitate the solution to different problems.</p>
	<p> A priority dispute of this principle by Mr. de Maupertuis had surfaced. Mr. König had at first forwarded a passage from a handwritten letter from Leibniz to prove that it was from this philosopher. This passage was published in the Actes de Leipzig, May 1751 , but contained an enormous error that Mr. König assured us was a printing mistake. He corrected the passage which in effect is part of the principle of least action. If Leibniz' letter was real (which is not for us to decide), but that this letter was never made public, it would allow this principle to belong to Mr. de Maupertuis; and Mr. König appears to have admitted in his Appeal to the public of the judgement that the Prussian Academy of Sciences had made an announcement against the authenticity of the fragment. Mr. König had at first quoted the letter to which we refer as written by Mr. Herman; but he has since recognized that he does not know to whom it was written. In his Appeal he produced the letter that can be read in its entirety. It is very long and it is dated Hanover, October 16 1707. Without the proper verification of its entire authenticity, it is only a matter of verifying that whoever gave it to Mr. König had added or altered the fragment in question. Mr. König is reported to have said that he received it from Mr. Henzi who was decapitated in Bern some years ago. He has said that he has in possession various other letters by Leibniz that this same Mr. Henzi had given to him; certain letters which are in Mr. Henzi's own hand. In regards to the letter to which we refer, Mr. König has not told us by who the letters were written, he has only mentioned that he has others that were written in the same hand, and that one of them is to be found in the published collection in-quarto and he has transcribed these letters in his Appeal . Mr. König has not said whether he has seen the original of this letter written by Leibniz himself. These are the facts and it is upon the public to judge whether the quoted fragment is authentic or not.</p>
	<p> We must also make the public aware that Mr. König provided for a theory concerning live forces in the Actes de Leipzig which is exactly the same as Mr. de Courtivron published in the Mémoires of the Academy 1748; page 304 and that Mr. de Courtivron had read it to the Academy before the publication of Mr. König's mémoire. See Center of Equilibrium.</p>
	<p> There only remains to say a word of the metaphysical usage that Mr. de Maupertuis has given to his principle. We think as we have already implied above that the definition of the quantity of action is a definition of a purely mathematical and arbitrary nature. One can call action the product of the mass by the speed or its square, or by any random function of space and time. Space and time are the two sole objects that we see clearly during the movement of bodies. One may introduce as many mathematical combinations as one wishes with these two issues and one may call all of this action, however the original and metaphysical word for action will not be any clearer. In general all of the theories of action are defined as one might wish, concerning the conservation of live forces, on a motionless or uniform center of gravity, or of other similar laws which are nothing more than mathematical theories of more or less generality and not of philosophical principles. For example, when two bodies are attached to a lever, one goes up and one comes down and one will find as did Mr. König that the sum of the live forces are nil because by adding opposite notations to the quantities that have different directional values: however these are geometrical realities and not metaphysical ones. In the end it is no less real for lives forces to possess opposite directional values and that they are no less real than it is possible to deny the existence of these forces. It is as thought one was saying that there is no motion in a body system when the same parts of the system are nil, that is to say that the quantities of motion are equal even though the directions are opposite, they are still real.</p>
	<p> Mr. de Maupertuis' principle is not a purely mathematical principle and it is suggested that he is not far from his mark especially since he did not participate in any way in the metaphysical question of live forces in which action is involved. See pages 15 and 16 of his works, published in Dresden 1752, in quarto. It is true that he has deduced the existence of God from his principle: but we can also deduce the existence of God from a purely mathematical principle when it is recognized that one believes that this principle can be observed in nature. Furthermore he has only given this proof on the existence of God as an example of proofs that are taken from the Universes' own general principles, an example to which he neither provides exclusive power nor superiority to any other proofs. He only suggests reasonably that one should apply oneself, especially when attempting to prove the existence of God by general phenomenon and not limited to any particular phenomenon even though he admits that this deduction has its utility. On this subject, one should see the preface of his work, where he is fully justified against ignorant critics and those who bear him ill-will and what they have done to him concerning this matter. Nothing is more fashionable today than the accusation of atheism; intended to defame the philosophers who are not. See also in this article on Cosmology, the Acts of Leipzig of May 1751, the Appeal of Mr. König to the public, the Mémoires of Berlin 1750 and 1751 (some inadvertently claim 1752); and in the Mémoires of the Paris Academy of Science 1749, a paper by Mr. d'Arcy on this topic. Here are (as it is now February 1754) the pieces that are absolutely necessary for the case since the question has been opened to discussion and those who have treated it are in possession of the facts. We must add that Mr. de Maupertuis has never responded to the insults that have been spewed at him on this matter to which we will add: nec noinetur in vobis, sicut decet philosophos. This quarrel regarding action , it if it is permitted for us to say, has gathered certain religious overtones due to its acerbic nature, and by a quantity of people that have spoken without listening.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Cosmology (from the Greek κόσμος, kosmos "world" and -λογία, -logia "study of") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.</p>
	<p> The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.</p>
	<p> Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.</p>
	<p> Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.</p>
	<p> Theoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the speed of light.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Disciplines</h4>
	<p> Physics and astrophysics have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation; an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago. Cosmogony studies the origin of the Universe, and cosmography maps the features of the Universe.</p>
	<p> In Diderot's Encyclopédie, cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).</p>
	<p> Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of man in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius's observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Physical cosmology</h3>
	<p> Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "celestial mechanics", the study of the heavens. Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos, Aristotle, and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories. The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when Nicolaus Copernicus, and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, proposed a heliocentric system. This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology.</p>
	<p> When Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica in 1687, he finally figured out how the heavens moved. Newton provided a physical mechanism for Kepler's laws and his law of universal gravitation allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle—that the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.</p>
	<p> Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with Albert Einstein's publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I). General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter, Karl Schwarzschild, and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter.</p>
	<p> In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda galaxy in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way.</p>
	<p> Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant, introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an expanding universe, depending on its value. Thus the Big Bang model was proposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by Edwin Hubble's discovery of the red shift in 1929 and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies.</p>
	<p> Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE, WMAP and Planck satellites, large new galaxy redshift surveys including 2dfGRS and SDSS, and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing. These observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory, a modified Big Bang theory, and the specific version known as the Lambda-CDM model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".</p>
	<p> On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the detection of gravitational waves, providing strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang. However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported.</p>
	<p> On 1 December 2014, at the Planck 2014 meeting in Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% atomic matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.</p>

	<h3> Religious or mythological cosmology</h3>
	<p> Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Philosophical cosmology</h3>
	<p> Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. The ancient Greeks did not draw a distinction between this use and their model for the cosmos. However, in modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like dialectics. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:</p>
	<p> • What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see monism, pantheism, emanationism and creationism)</p>
	<p> • What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see mechanism, dynamism, hylomorphism, atomism)</p>
	<p> • What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see teleology)</p>
	<p> • Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see epistemology).</p>`

	eArt:`<p> Education is the care one takes of feeding, bringing up and instructing children; thus education has as goals, 1) the health and good constitution of the body; 2) what regards the rectitude and the instruction of the mind; 3) manners, that is the conduct of life, and social qualities.</p>
	<p> Of Education in General. Children who come into the world, must form one day the society in which they will live. Their education is thus the most interesting subject, 1) for themselves, whom education must fashion such that they will be useful to that society, obtain its esteem, and find in it their well-being; 2) for their families, whom they must support and honor; 3) for the state itself, which must reap the fruits of the good education that the citizens that compose it receive.</p>
	<p> All children who come into the world must be subjected to the care of education , for there is none who is born completely instructed and completely educated. So what advantage does not accrue everyday to a state whose head has had his mind cultivated early, who has learned in History that the most stable empires are exposed to revolutions; who has been as much instructed in what he owes his subjects, as in what his subjects owe to him; to whom the source, the motive, the extent and the limits of his authority have been made known; to whom it has been taught that the sole certain means of conserving it and making it be respected, is to make good use of it? Erudimini qui judicatis terram [be wise, you rulers of the earth] Psalm II, 10. What happiness that of a state in which magistrates have early learned their duties, and have manners; where each citizen is warned that in coming into the world he has received a talent to render valuable; that he is member of a political body, and that in this capacity he must contribute to the common good, search for everything that can procure true advantages to society, and avoid what can disrupt its harmony, and disturb tranquility and good order! It is evident that there is no order of citizens in a state, for whom some kind of education is not proper; education for the children of sovereigns; education for the children of the great, for those of magistrates, etc; education for the children of the countryside, where, in the same way that there are schools for learning the truths of religion, there should be also those in which the exercises, the practices, the duties and the virtues of their social state could be shown to them, so that they might act with greater knowledge.</p>
	<p> If every kind of education were imparted with enlightenment and perseverance, the motherland would be well constituted, well governed, and protected from the insults of its neighbors.</p>
	<p> Education is the greatest good that fathers can leave to their children. One finds only too frequently fathers who do not know their true interests, refuse to spend what is necessary for a good education , and who save nothing afterwards to provide an occupation for their children, or to lend to them an honorable office [duty] ; yet what duty is more useful than a good education , which commonly does not cost so much, although it is the good whose product is the greatest, the most honorable and the most sensible? It pays back every day: other goods are often dissipated; but one cannot get rid of a good education , nor, unfortunately, of a bad one, which often is such because one has not wanted to defray the expenses of a good one:</p>
	<p> Sint Maecenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones [If there be many a Maecenas, Flaccus, many a Maro will not be lacking]. Martial, Epigrams , VIII, 56.</p>
	<p> You give your son to be educated by a slave , said one day an ancient philosopher to a rich father, very well, instead of one slave you shall have two .</p>
	<p> There is much analogy between the cultivation of plants and the education of children; in one and in the other nature must furnish the base. The owner of a field cannot make it be usefully cultivated, unless the terrain is proper to what he wants to produce in it; likewise, an enlightened father, and a master who has discernment and experience, must observe their student; and after a certain period of observation, they must disentangle his penchants, his inclinations, his taste, his character, and know what he is good for, and what role, so to speak, he must play in the concert of society.</p>
	<p> Do not force the inclinations of your children, but also do not allow them to choose lightly a station for which you foresee that they will realize in time they were not suitable. One must, as much as one can, spare them bad initiatives. Happy those children who have experienced parents capable of conducting them well in the choice of a station! A choice on which depends happiness or evil—without considering the rest of life.</p>
	<p> It will not be useless to say a word about each of the three subjects that are the objects of every education , as we said in the beginning. One should not assign anyone to the education of a child of either sex, unless that person has reflected seriously on these three points.</p>
	<p> I. Health . Monsieur Bronzet , ordinary doctor of the King, has recently given us a useful work on the medical education of children (published in Paris by Cavelier, 1754) . No one disputes the importance of this study, not only for early childhood, but also for all times of life. The Pagans had imagined a goddess whom they called Hygeia ; she was the goddess of health, dea salus ; this is the origin of the name of hygiene given to that branch of Medicine whose object is to give useful advice to prevent diseases, and to preserve health.</p>
	<p> It would be desirable that when young people have attained a certain age, they should be given some knowledge of anatomy and animal economy; that they should be taught up to a certain point about the chest, the lungs, the heart, the stomach, the circulation of blood, etc. , not to look after themselves when they are ill, but to have on these points knowledge that will be always useful, and which is an essential part of our self-knowledge. It is true that Nature leads us only by instinct with regard to our conservation; and I confess that a crippled person, who would know as much as possible about all the recesses of the stomach, and how all these recesses worked, would not for that reason digest food better than an ignorant man with a robust complexion, who enjoyed good health. Yet the knowledge of which I speak is very useful, not only because it satisfies the mind, but because it enables us to prevent many illnesses, and makes it possible for us to understand what people say on the subject.</p>
	<p> Without health, says the wise Charron, life is a burden, and even merit vanishes. What succour will wisdom bring to the greatest man, he continues, if he is stricken with the great malady or with apoplexy? Health is a gift of nature, but it is preserved, he goes on, by sobriety, by moderate exercise, by the distancing of sadness and of every passion  .</p>
	<p> For young people, the most important point in this advice is temperance of every kind: the contrary vice causes a greater number of people to die than the sword, plus occidit gula quam gladius [gluttony kills more than the sword].</p>
	<p> One begins usually by being prodigal with one’s health; and when afterwards one decides to become economical, one feels with regret that one has decided too late.</p>
	<p> Habit of every kind has much power over us; but we do not have very precise ideas on this subject: this man has over time become accustomed to sleeping a few hours, whereas that man has never been able to do without longer sleep.</p>
	<p> I know that among savages, and even in our countryside, some children are born with such good health, that they cross rivers swimming, endure cold, hunger, thirst, sleep deprivation, and when they fall ill, nature itself heals them without the aid of remedies. From this it follows that one must submit to the wise foresight of nature, and that one gets used to everything; but that conclusion is not right, because it is drawn from insufficient data. Those who reason thus, have no regard for the infinite number of children who succumb to such weariness, and who are victims of the prejudice, that one can get used to everything . Besides, is it not probable that those who have withstood the weariness and the hard trials of which we have spoken, would have lived much longer if they had been able to take it easier?</p>
	<p> In a word, let us have no softness, nothing effeminate in the manner of bringing up children; but let us not believe that everything is equally good for all, and that Mithridates became used to real poison . One does not get used to real poison, any more than one does to knife-stabbing. Tsar Peter wanted his sailors to accustom their children to drink only seawater: they all died. The suitability and unsuitability that exist between our bodies and other beings, attains [sic; attain] only a certain point; and that point must be shown to us by the particular experience of each one of us.</p>
	<p> There is a continual diffusion within us of spirits and juices necessary for the conservation of life and health; these spirits and these juices must hence be replenished; yet they can only be so by nourishment analogous to the particular machine of each individual.</p>
	<p> It would be desirable for some skilled physician, who would add experience to enlightenment and reflection, to give us a treatise on the power and the limits of habit.</p>
	<p> I will add one more word that relates to this subject. This is that the society that interests itself with reason in the conservation of its citizens, has instituted long examinations, before allowing a private person to exercise publicly the art of healing. Yet despite these wise precautions, the taste for the marvelous and the penchant that some people have to diverge from the common rule, makes things such that when they fall ill, they would rather put themselves in the hands of private persons without character, who agree upon their ignorance themselves, and who have no resource but the mystery they make of a supposed secret, and in the imbecility of the people they dupe. See the judicious letter of Monsieur de Moncrif, in the second volume of his works, page 141, on empiricist doctors and charlatans. It would be useful for young people to be enlightened early on this point. I admit that sometimes disadvantages ensue from following the rules, but where do they never happen? They happen only too frequently, for example, in the construction of buildings; must one for that reason not call an architect, and put oneself in the hands of a simple worker?</p>
	<p> II. The second object of education , is the mind that one must enlighten, instruct, adorn, and regulate. One may soften the most ferocious mind, says Horace, as long as it has the docility to give itself to instruction.</p>
	<p> Nemo adeo ferus est, ut non mitescere possit, si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem [None is so savage that he cannot be tamed, if he will only lend a patient ear to discipline] Horace, Epistles , I, 39-40.</p>
	<p> Docility, the condition that the poet demands in the disciple, that virtue, I say, so rare, requires a fortunate basis that nature alone can provide, but thanks to which an able teacher leads his student quite far. On the other hand, it is necessary that the teacher have the talent to cultivate minds, and that he have the art of rendering his student docile, without his student realizing that the teacher is working to render him so, failing which the teacher will not pluck the fruits of his care. He must have a sweet and sociable mind, know how to seize skillfully the moment when the lesson will produce its effect without looking like a lesson; this is why when it comes to choosing a teacher, one must prefer to the scholar who has a solid mind, the one who has less erudition, but who is sociable and judicious. Erudition is a good that one may acquire; while reason, an insinuating mind, and a sweet temper, are gifts of nature. Docendi recte sapere est principium et fons [Good sense is the principle and the source of teaching] ; in order to instruct well, one must first have right sense. But let us return to our students.</p>
	<p> One must admit that there are species of mind that never enter into the thoughts of others; these are hard and inflexible minds, dura cervice... et cordibus et auribus. [hard necks... and hearts and ears] Acts of the Apostles, VII, 51.</p>
	<p> There are awkward people, who never understand what is said to them in the sense that presents itself naturally, and which everyone else understands. In addition, there are certain states in which one cannot listen to instruction; such is the state of passion, the state of derangement in the organs of the brain, the state of disease, the state of old prejudice, etc. Yet when it comes to teaching, one always assumes that students have that flexible and free mind that puts the pupil in the position of understanding everything that is within his reach, and which is presented to him with order and following the generation and the natural relation between elements of knowledge.</p>
	<p> With regard to the mind, the first years of childhood require much more care than is commonly given to them, so that it is often very difficult afterwards to erase the bad impressions that a young man has had through the discourses and the examples of people of little sense and little enlightenment, who were near him in those first years.</p>
	<p> From the moment that a child lets it be known by his look and by his gestures that he understands what is said to him, he should be regarded as a subject proper to be submitted to the jurisdiction of education , whose goal is to form the mind, and set aside what can lead it astray. It would be desirable for him to be approached only by sensible people, and for him to see and hear nothing but good. The first instances of sensible acquiescence in our mind, or, to speak in common parlance, the first knowledge or the first ideas that form within us during the first years of our life, are as many models that it is difficult to refashion, and which later serve us as rules in the use that we make of our reason. Thus it is extremely important for a young man to acquiesce only to what is true, that is to what is , as soon as he has judgment. So keep him away from all fabulous stories, from all puerile tales of Fairies, of werewolves, of wandering Jews, of goblins, of ghosts, of wizards, of spells, told by those makers of horoscopes, those fortune-tellers male and female, those interpreters of dreams, and so many other superstitious practices that serve only to lead astray children’s reason, to frighten their imagination, and often even to make them regret having come into the world.</p>
	<p> Persons who amuse themselves by frightening children are very reprehensible. It has often happened that the weak organs of children’s brains have been deranged for the rest of their lives, besides their mind being filled with ridiculous prejudices, etc. The more these chimerical ideas are extraordinary, the more deeply ingrained they become in the brain.</p>
	<p> One must not blame less those who amuse themselves by tricking children, leading them into error, deluding them into believing things, and who congratulate themselves instead of being ashamed. In such instances it is the young man who has the good part; he does not yet know that there are persons whose soul is low enough to speak against their thought, and who affirm shameful falsehoods in the same tone in which honest people say the most certain truths; he has not yet learned to suspect; he puts himself in your hands, and you trick him: all those false ideas become as many exemplary ideas, which lead children’s reason astray. I would have it that instead of thus taming the mind of young people with charm and lies, one never told them anything but the truth.</p>
	<p> One should teach them the practice of the arts, even the most common art; they would afterwards draw great advantages from this knowledge. An ancient writer complains that when young people leave school, and come into the company of other men, they believe themselves transported into a new world: ut cum in forum venerint, existiment se in alium terrarum orbem delatos [when they come into the forum, they believe themselves transported into another sphere of the earth] . How dangerous it is to let young people of both sexes acquire experience on their own and at their expense, to let them be ignorant of the fact that seducers and cheaters exist, until they have been seduced and cheated! The reading of history would supply a great number of examples that would give very useful lessons.</p>
	<p> One should also let young people see experiments in Physics early on. One can find in the description of many machines of common usage, an ample harvest of instructive and amusing facts, capable of exciting the curiosity of young people; such are the various kinds of phosphorus, the stone of Bologna, inflammable powder, the effects of magnets and those of electricity, those of the rarefaction and the weight of air, etc. In the beginning it is sufficient to make the instruments well known, and show the effects that result from their combination and operation. Do you see this sort of leather ball (the eolipile, it is empty on the inside, there is only air; observe this little pipe that is attached to it and which is connected to the inside, it is pierced at the tip; what would you do to fill this ball with water, and to empty it after it was filled? I’m going to make it fill up with water, after which I will make a squirt of water come out of it. In the beginning one shows only the facts, and delays for a later age the most probable explanations that Philosophers have imagined. How many disadvantages men who actually had merit have suffered, for not having known these little mysteries of Nature!</p>
	<p> I am going to add a few reflections, which I know that those teachers who have zeal and discernment will be able to use amply to guide well the minds of their young students.</p>
	<p> It is well known that children are not in a position to understand combined reasoning or assertions, which are the result of profound meditations; thus it would be ridiculous to converse with them regarding what Philosophers say about the origin of our knowledge, about the interdependence, the links, the subordination and order of ideas, about false suppositions, about bad counting, about hastiness, finally about all kinds of sophisms. But I would like for the people placed near children to be sufficiently instructed on all these points, and that when a child, for instance, in his answers or in his remarks, supposes what is being asked, I would like, I say, for his teacher to know that his student is falling into circular reasoning, but that without using that scientific expression, he made his young pupil feel that his answer is deficient, because it is the same thing that is being asked of him. Confess your ignorance: say, I do not know , rather than make a reply that explains nothing; it is as if you said that sugar is sweet because it has sweetness; is it to say something other than that it is sweet because it is sweet?</p>
	<p> I would really like that among the persons who are destined by their station to the education of youth, some judicious teacher might be found who would give us children’s logic in the form of dialogues for the use of teachers . One could include in that work a great number of examples, which would dispose students little by little to precepts and to rules. I would have liked to report here some of these examples, but I feared they might appear too puerile.</p>
	<p> We have already remarked, relying on Horace, that only young people who have a flexible mind can benefit from the cares of the education of the mind. But what is it to have a flexible mind? It is being in a position to listen well and to answer well; it is understanding what is said to us, precisely with the meaning that it has in the mind of the person who speaks to us, and to answer with reference to that meaning.</p>
	<p> If you must instruct a young man who is lucky enough to have that flexible mind, you must above all be very careful not to tell him anything new that does not relate to what life experience may have taught him already.</p>
	<p> The great secret of didactics, that is, of the art of teaching, is to be able to tease apart the hierarchy of knowledge. Before speaking of tens, know whether your young man has the idea of one ; before speaking to him of the army , show him a soldier , and teach him what is a captain , and when his imagination can represent this group of soldiers and officers, speak to him of the general.</p>
	<p> When we come into the world, we live, but we are not at first capable of this reflection, I am, I live , and even less of this other, I feel, therefore I exist . We have not yet seen enough particular beings, to have the abstract idea of exist and existence . We are born with the faculty of conceiving and reflecting; but we cannot then say reasonably that we have this or that particular knowledge, or that we reflect on this or that individual thing, and even less that we have some general knowledge, since it is evident that general knowledge can be the result only of particular knowledge: I could not say that every triangle has three sides , if I did not know what a triangle was. When once, through the consideration of one of several particular triangles, I have acquired the exemplary idea of triangle, I decide that everything that is in conformity with this idea is triangle , and that what is not in conformity is not triangle .</p>
	<p> How could I understand that it is necessary to give back to each what is due to him , if I still did not know what is to give back , what is to be due , or what is each ? Life experience has taught these things to us, and it is only then that we have understood the axiom.</p>
	<p> Thus when we come into the world we have the organs necessary for speaking and all those that will afterwards serve us to walk; but in the first days of our life we do not yet speak and we do not yet walk: it is only after the organs of the brain have acquired a certain consistency, and after life experience has given us some preliminary knowledge; it is only then, I say, that we can understand some of the principles and some of the truths regarding which our teachers speak to us; they understand these principles and these truths, and it is for this reason that they imagine that their students must also understand them; but the teachers have had experience, and the students are only beginning to have experience. They have not yet acquired enough of that preliminary knowledge assumed by subsequent knowledge:</p>
	<p> “Our soul, says Father Buffier, a Jesuit, in his Traité des premières vérités, [1724] Part III, page 8 , our soul operates only insofar as our body is disposed to such operation, through the mutual relationship and the reciprocal connection that exists between our soul and our body. The thing is indubitable, continues that knowledgeable metaphysician, and the experience of it quotidian. It even seems beyond doubt, goes on Father Buffier, in the same Traité , Part I, pages 32 and 33 , that children have acquired through experience much knowledge of sensible objects, before arriving at knowledge of the existence of God: this is what the Apostle St Paul suggests to us by these remarkable words: invisibilia enim ipsius Dei a creatura mundi per ea quae facta sunt, intellecta conspiciuntur. [For since the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities have been evident to the intellect, being understood from what has been made.][”] Romans, I, 20. For my part, continues Father Buffier on page 271 , [“]I know the Creator naturally only through his creatures: I can conceive an idea of him only insofar as they provide it.[”] Indeed the heavens announce his glory: caeli enarrant gloriam Dei [the heavens tell the glory of God], Psalms XVIII, 1. It is improbable that a man deprived since childhood of his senses could access easily the idea of God; but although the idea of God is not innate, and although it is not a first truth, according to Father Buffier, it does not at all follow —he adds— ibid. page 33 —[“]that it is not a very natural and a very easy sort of knowledge.[”] That same, very respectable father adds, ibid. Part III, page 9 that [“]since the relationship of dependence whereby the body belongs to the soul does not mean that the body is spiritual, in the same way the relationship of dependence whereby the soul belongs to the body, does not mean that the soul is corporeal. Those two parts of man have in their operations an intimate connection; but the connection between two parts does not make it such that one is the other.”</p>
	<p> Indeed, the hand of a clock marks the hours of the day in turn only through the movement that it receives from the dented wheels, and which is communicated to them by the spring: water could not boil without fire; does it follow from that that the gears are of the same nature as the spring, and that water has the same nature as fire?</p>
	<p> We perceive clearly that the soul is not the body, in the same way that fire is not water, says Father Buffier , Traité des premières vérités, Part III, page 10 , thus we cannot reasonably deny, he adds, that the body and mind are two different substances. </p>
	<p> It is in consequence of the principles that we have exposed, and as a result of the subordination in the linking of our ideas, that some teachers are persuaded that in order to teach young people a dead language, Latin , for instance, or Greek , one must not begin by Latin or Greek declensions; because since French nouns are not declined, children in saying musa, musae, musam, musarum, musis, etc. are not yet able to see where they are going; it is more simple and more in conformity with the way in which ideas link up in the mind, to make them study Latin first in an interlinear manner whereby the Latin words are explained in French, and arranged in the order of simple construction, which alone lends meaning. When the children say they remember the meaning of each word, one shows them those same Latin expressions in the practice book where they actually find them again in the same order, but without French under the Latin words. The young people are then delighted to come up on their own with the French word that corresponds with the Latin word, and that the interlinear version has shown to them. This exercise encourages them and avoids disgust, familiarizing them first through sentiment and practice with the purpose of declensions, and with the use that the ancients made of them.</p>
	<p> After some days of exercise, when the children have seen sometimes Diana , sometimes Dianam , Apollo, Apollinem, etc. and which in French is always Diane , and always Apollon , they are the first to ask the reason for these differences, and it is then that they are taught to decline.</p>
	<p> Thus to make known the taste of a fruit, instead of taking pleasure in vain discourse, it is more simple to show that fruit and to make it be tasted; otherwise one teaches how to guess, how to draw without a model, one wants to harvest something from a field that one has not sown.</p>
	<p> Afterwards, when they see a word that is in the same case as the one to which it refers, or in a different case, Diana soror Apollinis [Diana is the sister of Apollo] , the teacher explains to them the relationship of identity, and the relationship or reason of determination. Diana soror , those two words are in the same case, because Diana and sister is the same person: soror Apollinis, Apollinis determines soror , that is to say, makes Diana known as a sister . All of syntax is reduced to these two relationships as I said a long time ago. This method of beginning by explaining, seems to me the only one that follows the order, the dependence, the linkage and the subordination of ideas. See Case, Construction, and the various works that have been written to explain this method, to make its practice easier, and to answer some objections that were first made with a little too much precipitation. I remember, besides, that in my youth I did not like it when, after having explained to me some lines of Cicero, which I was just beginning to understand, they put me immediately to the task of explaining ten or twelve verses of Virgil; it is as if, in order to explain French to a foreigner, one made him read a scene or a few plays of Racine, and that in the same lesson one began to read a scene from The Misanthrope or some other play by Molière. Is this a practice that makes one take interest in what one reads, that makes one develop a taste for it, and contributes to forming the idea of the exemplary and the beautiful?</p>
	<p> Let us pursue our reflections on the cultivation of the mind.</p>
	<p> We have already remarked that man is capable of many states of mind. There is especially the state of sleep, which is a kind of periodical, and yet necessary, infirmity, wherein, as in many other maladies, we cannot make use of that flexibility and that freedom of mind that is so necessary for us to distinguish truth from error.</p>
	<p> Observe that during sleep we cannot think of any object, unless we have seen it before, either as a whole, or in part: the image of the sun, or that of the stars, or that of a flower, will never present themselves to the imagination of a newborn child who sleeps, nor to that of a man born blind who wakes. If sometimes the image of a bizarre object that never existed in nature presents itself to us during sleep, that is because through the use of eyesight we have seen, at various times and in various objects, the various members of which that chimerical Being is composed. This is the kind of picture of which Homer speaks at the beginning of his poetic art; the head of a beautiful woman, the neck of a horse, the feathers of different species of birds, lastly the tail of a fish; such are the parts whose whole forms that strange picture that never had an original.</p>
	<p> Newborn children that have not yet seen anything, and those born blind, could not make such combinations in their sleep; they have only the intimate feeling which is a necessary consequence of the fact that they are living and animated beings, and of the fact that they have organs where the blood and the spirits circulate, united to a spiritual substance through a link whose secret the Creator has reserved to himself.</p>
	<p> The feeling of which I speak could not be in the first instance a conscious feeling, as we have already remarked, because the child cannot yet have an idea of his own individuality, or of himself. That conscious feeling of me only comes to him afterwards through the aid of memory, which reminds him of the various kinds of sensations with which he has been affected; but at the same time he remembers and he is conscious of having always been the same individual, although affected at different times and differently; there is the me.</p>
	<p> An indolent man who after working for a few hours abandons himself to his indolence and his laziness, without preoccupying himself with any particular object, is he not, at least during a few moments, in the situation of the newborn child, who feels because he is alive, but who does not yet have that conscious idea, I feel?</p>
	<p> We have already observed, with Father Buffier, that our soul operates only insofar as our body is in a certain disposition (Traité des premières vérités, Part III, page 8): the thing is indubitable and the experience quotidian, adds that respectable philosopher. (Ibid .) </p>
	<p> Indeed, do not the organs of the senses and those of the brain seem destined to execute the operations of the soul as it is united with the body? And since the body finds itself in various states according to age, according to the air of the various climates where it lives, according to the food with which it feeds itself, etc. and since it is subject to different diseases, due to the various alterations that happen to its parts; in the same way, the mind is subject to various infirmities, and finds itself in various states, due either to the disposition of the organs destined to execute its functions, or to the various accidents that happen to those organs.</p>
	<p> When the members of our bodies have acquired a certain consistency, we walk, we are at first able to carry small loads from one place to another; afterwards we can lift and transport bigger ones; but if some obstacle impedes the course of animal minds, none of these movements can be executed.</p>
	<p> In the same way, when we have arrived at a certain age, the organs of our senses and those of our brain find themselves in the state necessary to enable the soul to exercise its functions with a certain degree of rectitude, according to the institution of nature, which the general experience of all men teaches us; one says then that one has arrived at the age of reason. But if it happens that the working of these organs is troubled, the functions of the soul are interrupted: that is what one sees only too often in imbeciles, in fools, in people with epilepsy, in people with apoplexy, in patients who have an excitement in the brain, lastly in those who indulge in violent passions.</p>
	<p> That proud reason that people vaunt so much,</p>
	<p> [...] a bit of wine clouds it, a child seduces it.</p>
	<p> Des Houlieres, Idyle des moutons [n.d.].</p>
	<p> Thus the mind has its diseases like the body, indocility, stubbornness, prejudice, precipitateness, inability to listen to the reflections of others, passions, etc .</p>
	<p> But can one not cure the diseases of the mind, says Cicero? One can cure well those of the body, he adds. His nulla - nè est adhibenda curatio? an quòd corpora curari possint, animorum medicina nulla sit? [What? Can one not attempt to apply a cure? [...] Is it because the body will admit of a cure, that there is no medicine whatever for the mind?] Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, Book III, Chapter II . [“]Multiple physical observations in medicine and anatomy, says the learned author of the Économie animale , tome III, page 215, second edition, published in Paris by Cavelier 1747 prove to us that our knowledge depends on the organic faculties of the body.[”] That testimony added to that of Father Buffier and of so many other respectable scholars, makes it evident that there are two kinds of natural means to cure the diseases of the mind, at least those that can be cured; the first means is diet, temperance, continence, the use of food proper to cure each kind of mental disease (See Médecine de l’esprit , by Monsieur Le Camus, published by Ganneau, [sic; Ganeau] [2 vols.], Paris, 1753), avoidance of and privation from everything that can irritate those diseases. It is certain that when the stomach is not overloaded, and digestion is easy, the liquors flow without alteration in their channels, and the soul exercises its functions without obstacle.</p>
	<p> Besides these means, Cicero exhorts us to study the lessons of wisdom, and above all to have a sincere desire to be cured. This is a beginning of health that makes us avoid everything that can keep the disease alive. Animi sanari voluerint, praeceptis sapientium paruerint; fiet ut sine ullâ dubitatione sanentur. [Those minds that are disposed to be cured, and submit to the precepts of the wise, may undoubtedly recover a healthy state] . Cicero, Tusculan Disputations , Book III, Chapter 3 .</p>
	<p> When we are in a position to reflect on our sensations, we realize that we have feelings, of which some are agreeable, and the others more or less painful; and we cannot doubt that these feelings or sensations are excited in us by a cause different from ourselves, since we cannot make them be born, or suspend them, or make them cease precisely as we like. Do not experience and our intimate feeling teach us that these feelings come to us from an external cause, and that they are excited within us on the occasion of impressions that objects make on our senses, according to a certain immutable order established in all of nature, and recognized everywhere where there are men?</p>
	<p> It is on the basis of these impressions that we judge objects and their properties; these first impressions give us occasion later to reflect in a manner that always presupposes those impressions, independently of the habitual or actual disposition of the brain, and in accordance with the laws of the union of soul and body. One must always think of the soul in its state of waking, when it knows amply that it is not shrouded in the darkness of sleep; one must suppose it in a state of health, in a word in that state in which, freed from all passion and all prejudice, it exercises its functions with enlightenment and freedom: since during sleep, or even during waking, we cannot think of any object, unless it has made some impression on us since we have been in the world.</p>
	<p> Since we cannot by our sole will avoid the effect of a sensation, for example, avoid seeing during the day, when our eyes are open, nor excite, nor keep nor make the least sensation cease; since it is a constant axiom in Philosophy that our thoughts add nothing to what objects are in themselves, cogitare tuum nil ponit in re [your thinking puts nothing in the thing] ; since all effect supposes a cause; since no being can modify itself, and since everything that changes, is changed by something else; since the elements of our knowledge are not particular beings, and since it is only in knowing ourselves , in the same way that each look from our eyes looks only at us , and that all these words, knowledge, idea, thought, judgment, life, death, nothingness, sickness, health, sight , etc. are only abstract terms that we have invented on the model and in imitation of words that designate real beings, like Sun, Moon, Earth, Stars , etc. and these abstract terms have seemed convenient to convey what we think to other men, who make the same use of it as ourselves, which dispenses us from resorting to periphrases and circumlocutions that would make discourse languish; given all these considerations, it seems evident that each individual element of knowledge must have its particular cause, or its own motive.</p>
	<p> That motive must have two conditions equally necessary and inseparable.</p>
	<p> It must be external, that is it must not come from our own imagination, as it comes in sleep: cogitare tuum nil ponit in re.</p>
	<p> It must be its own motive, that is the one supposed by the particular element of knowledge, without which that thought would never have appeared in the mind.</p>
	<p> Some philosophers of antiquity had imagined that there were Antipodes; the proofs that they gave of their supposition were quite probable, but they were only probable; whereas today when we go to the Antipodes, and come back from them; today when there is established commerce between the peoples who live there and ourselves, we have a legitimate motive, an external motive, a proper motive, to affirm that there are Antipodes.</p>
	<p> That Greek who imagined that all the ships that arrived in the Pyraeus belonged to him, judged only from what was happening in his imagination and in the internal sense, which is the organ of the acquiescence of the mind; there was no external and suitable motive; what he thought had no relation to the reality of things: cogitare tuum nil ponit in re . A watch always marks some hour; but it marks it well only when it is in accordance with the Sun: our intimate feeling, aided by circumstances, makes us feel the relation between our judgment and the reality of things. When we are awake, we feel that we do not sleep; when we are in good health, we are persuaded that we are not ill: thus when we judge on the basis of a legitimate motive, we are convinced that our judgment is well founded, and that we would be wrong to judge differently. Souls who have the good fortune to be united with well-made minds, move from the state of passion, or of error and prejudice, to the tranquil state of reason, where they exercise their functions with enlightenment and freedom.</p>
	<p> It would be easy to report a great number of examples, to demonstrate the necessity of an external, proper, legitimate motive in all our judgments, even those that regard faith: Fides ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum Christi [Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is also heard through the word of Christ] , says St Paul (Romans , X, 17).</p>
	<p> “On points so sublime, says Father Buffier, (Traité des premières vérités, Part III, page 237), we find a judicious and plausible motive, a certain one, that cannot make us go astray , to submit our feeble natural intelligence to the infinite intelligence of God... who has revealed certain truths, and to the wise authority of the Church which teaches us that God has effectively revealed them. If one attended to these first truths in the science of Theology, adds Father Buffier (ibid .), their study would become much more easy and more abridged, and the result of it would be more solid and more extensive.” </p>
	<p> It would thus be a very useful practice to ask a young man often the motive of his judgment, on even very common occasions, especially when one realizes that he is in the process of imagining things, and that he is saying what is not substantiated.</p>
	<p> When young people are able to begin serious study, it is a very useful practice, after having taught them the different kinds of government, to make them read gazettes, with geographical maps and with dictionaries that explain certain words that often even the teacher does not understand. This practice is at first disagreeable to the young people, because they are still not aware of anything, and what they read does not link up in their minds with acquired ideas. But little by little this reading interests them, especially when their vanity is flattered by the praise that older people purposefully give them on that point.</p>
	<p> I know certain judicious teachers who, to impart to young people certain useful knowledge, make them read and explain to them the state of France and the royal almanac; and I believe this practice to be very useful.</p>
	<p> One would still have to speak of manners and social qualities. But we have so many good books on this subject, that I think I must refer the reader to them.</p>
	<p> We have in the military school a model of education , which all persons who are in charge of bringing up young people, should try to emulate; either with regard to health, food, cleanliness, decency, etc . or with regard to what concerns the cultivation of the mind. People never lose sight of the principal aim of the establishment, and they work in shifts to acquire the knowledge related to that object: to this kind [of knowledge] belong Languages, Geometry, Fortifications, the science of Numbers, etc . It is teachers skilled in each of these subjects who have been chosen to teach them.</p>
	<p> As for morals, they are in safety there, as much thanks to good examples, as to the impossibility in which young people find themselves to acquire relations that could divert them from their duty. They are enlightened at all times and in all places. Perpetual vigilance never loses sight of them: this vigilance is exercised during the day and during the night, by wise persons who succeed each other in shifts. Happy are the young people who have the good fortune to be accepted in that school! They will come out with a fortified character, with a mind proper to their station, with a cultivated mind, with morals that the habit of many years will have protected from seduction: lastly with the feelings of gratitude, with which one can see that they are already affected; firstly toward the powerful King, who like a tender father procures for them such great advantages; secondly toward the enlightened minister, who favors the execution of so beautiful a project; thirdly, toward the zealous persons who preside immediately over this execution, who guide it with wisdom, with firmness, and with a lack of self-interest that cannot be sufficiently praised. See Military school, Study, Class, College, etc.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>
	<p> Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>
	<p> A right to education has been recognized by some governments, including at the global level: Article 13 of the United Nations' 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes a universal right to education. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>
	<p> Etymology</p>
	<p> Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to the homonym ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō ("I lead, I conduct").</p>
	<p> History</p>
	<p> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
	<p> Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>
	<p> In China, Confucius (551-479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.</p>
	<p> After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.</p>
	<p> Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under the Islamic caliphate which was established across the Middle East, extending from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire in the south.</p>
	<p> The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations — as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.</p>
	<p> In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.</p>
	<p> Formal education</p>
	<p> Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.</p>
	<p> Preschool</p>
	<p> Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where kindergarten is a term used for primary education. Kindergarten "provide a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."</p>
	<p> Primary</p>
	<p> Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school.</p>
	<p> In India, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training.</p>
	<p> Secondary</p>
	<p> In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, "postsecondary", or "higher" education (e.g. university, vocational school) for adults. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or high schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, middle schools, colleges, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as K-12 education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.</p>
	<p> Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.</p>
	<p> Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of public schools, fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.</p>
	<p> Community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.</p>
	<p> Tertiary (higher)</p>
	<p> Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.</p>
	<p> Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.</p>
	<p> University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent like Yale University; public and state-governed like the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education; or independent but state-funded like the University of Virginia. A number of career specific courses are now available to students through the Internet.</p>
	<p> One type of university education is a liberal arts education, which can be defined as a "college or university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum." Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in Europe, the term "liberal arts college" is more commonly associated with institutions in the United States.</p>
	<p> Vocational</p>
	<p> Vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts.</p>
	<p> Special</p>
	<p> Main article: Special education</p>
	<p> In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors. These early physicians (people like Itard, Seguin, Howe, Gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.</p>
	<p> Other educational forms</p>
	<p> Alternative</p>
	<p> Main article: Alternative education</p>
	<p> While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. Alternative education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. Example alternative schools include Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (or Steiner schools), Friends schools, Sands School, Summerhill School, Walden's Path, The Peepal Grove School, Sudbury Valley School, Krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools. Charter schools are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.</p>
	<p> In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as Friedrich Fröbel's approach to early childhood education in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary kindergarten classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the Swiss humanitarian Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi; the American transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau; the founders of progressive education, John Dewey and Francis Parker; and educational pioneers such as Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner, and more recently John Caldwell Holt, Paul Goodman, Frederick Mayer, George Dennison, and Ivan Illich.</p>
	<p> Indigenous</p>
	<p> Indigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."</p>
	<p> Informal learning</p>
	<p> Main article: informal learning</p>
	<p> Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners. Informal learning for young people is an ongoing process that also occurs in a variety of places, such as out of school time, in youth programs at community centres and media labs.</p>
	<p> Informal learning usually takes place outside educational establishments, does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements. It is not necessarily planned to be pedagogically conscious, systematic and according to subjects, but rather unconsciously incidental, holistically problem-related, and related to situation management and fitness for life. It is experienced directly in its "natural" function of everyday life and is often spontaneous.</p>
	<p> The concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. L.P. Jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well." Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. The concept has been revived by the University of Western Ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.</p>
	<p> Self-directed learning</p>
	<p> Main article: Autodidacticism</p>
	<p> Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is a contemplative, absorbing process, of "learning on your own" or "by yourself", or as a self-teacher. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. Notable autodidacts include Abraham Lincoln (U.S. president), Srinivasa Ramanujan (mathematician), Michael Faraday (chemist and physicist), Charles Darwin (naturalist), Thomas Alva Edison (inventor), Tadao Ando (architect), George Bernard Shaw (playwright), Frank Zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director), and Leonardo da Vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician).</p>
	<p> Open education and electronic technology</p>
	<p> Main articles: Open education and Educational technology</p>
	<p> In 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning. Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods. Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. Online courses often can be more expensive than face-to-face classes. Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones. Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form edX. Other universities offering open education are Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U. Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington, and Caltech. It has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press. Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.</p>
	<p> The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open University in the United Kingdom. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "academic value" to traditional degrees. Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.</p>
	<p> A culture is beginning to form around distance learning for people who are looking to social connections enjoyed on traditional campuses. For example, students may create study groups, meetups, and movements such as UnCollege.</p>
	<p> Education sector</p>
	<p> The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.</p>
	<p> Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer –, curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.</p>
	<p> The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, child protection, justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.</p>
	<p> Development goals</p>
	<p> Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.</p>
	<p> Universal Primary Education is one of the eight international Millennium Development Goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. Additionally, Transparency International has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa. Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.</p>
	<p> A study conducted by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:</p>
	<p> national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;</p>
	<p> strategies must be context relevant and context specific;</p>
	<p> plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;</p>
	<p> partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;</p>
	<p> outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;</p>
	<p> a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).</p>
	<p> Internationalization</p>
	<p> Nearly every country now has Universal Primary Education.</p>
	<p> Similarities—in systems or even in ideas—that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-Erasmus Program facilitates exchanges across European universities. The Soros Foundation provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the International Baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.</p>
	<p> Education and technology in developing countries</p>
	<p> Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.</p>
	<p> The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.</p>
	<p> In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an "e-school program" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.</p>
	<p> India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.</p>
	<p> Private vs public funding in developing countries</p>
	<p> Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy. The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs. Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:</p>
	<p> Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.</p>
	<p> Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.</p>
	<p> Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.</p>
	<p> Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.</p>
	<p> The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programmes; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread. Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.</p>
	<p> Educational theory</p>
	<p> Educational psychology</p>
	<p> Main article: Educational psychology</p>
	<p> Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities.</p>
	<p> Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006).</p>
	<p> The intelligence–education relationship</p>
	<p> Main article: Psychology of education</p>
	<p> Intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education. This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence. Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.</p>
	<p> Learning modalities</p>
	<p> There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:</p>
	<p> Visual: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.</p>
	<p> Auditory: learning based on listening to instructions/information.</p>
	<p> Kinesthetic: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.</p>
	<p> Other commonly employed modalities include musical, interpersonal, verbal, logical, and intrapersonal.</p>
	<p> Dunn and Dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as Joseph Renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies. Howard Gardner identified a wide range of modalities in his Multiple Intelligences theories. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Keirsey Temperament Sorter, based on the works of Jung, focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of David Kolb and Anthony Gregorc's Type Delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.</p>
	<p> Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning. Recent research has argued, "there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice."</p>
	<p> Mind, Brain and Education</p>
	<p> Educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.</p>
	<p> Philosophy</p>
	<p> As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems (...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy". "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline." As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice.</p>
	<p> Purpose of education</p>
	<p> There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.</p>
	<p> Curriculum</p>
	<p> Main articles: Curriculum, Curriculum theory, and List of academic disciplines</p>
	<p> In formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. As an idea, curriculum stems from the Latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.</p>
	<p> An academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, humanities and applied sciences.</p>
	<p> Educational institutions may incorporate fine arts as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at colleges and universities as electives. The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.</p>
	<p> Instruction</p>
	<p> Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.</p>
	<p> College basketball coach John Wooden the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.</p>
	<p> Economics of education</p>
	<p> It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth. Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "human capital". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills.</p>
	<p> At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of Jacob Mincer, on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling. Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high intelligence quotient, may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.</p>
	<p> Economists Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the egalitarian goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.</p>`

	eArt:`<p> Encyclopedia. This word signifies chain of knowledge ; it is composed of the Greek preposition ἐν , in , and the nouns κύκλος , circle , and παιδεία , knowledge .</p>
	<p> Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race.</p>
	<p> It would have been difficult to propose a more extensive object than covering everything related to human curiosity, duty, needs, and pleasures. For this reason some persons accustomed to judge the possibilities of an enterprise by the limited resources they recognize in themselves have pronounced that we will never bring ours to completion. See the most recent edition of the Dictionnaire de Trévoux , article Encyclopedia . They shall have as sole reply this passage from Chancellor Bacon, which seems to address them specifically: De impossibilitate itá flatuo ; et omnia possibilia et praestabilia esse censenda quae ab aliquibus perfici possunt, licét non á quibusvis ; et quae á multis conjunctim, licét non ab uno ; et quae in successione saeculorum, licét non eodem aevo ; et denique quae multorum curâ et sumptf, licét non opibus et industriâ singulorum . (Bac. lib. II. De augment. scient. cap. j. pag. 103 .) </p>
	<p> When one considers the immense material for an encyclopedia , the only thing one perceives distinctly is that it cannot be the work of a single man. How could a single man, in the short span of his life, manage to comprehend and develop the universal system of nature and art? Whereas the numerous scientific community of La Crusca   spent forty years constituting its vocabulary, and whereas our French Academicians had labored for sixty years on their dictionary,  before producing its first editon!  Yet what is the dictionary of a language? What is a lexicon, even executed as well as it can be? A precise collection of the articles to be filled in by an encyclopedic and analytical dictionary. </p>
	<p> It will be said that a single man is master of all that exists, and will dispose as he wishes of all the riches that other men have accumulated. I cannot agree to this principle: I do not believe it is given to a single man to know all that can be known, to make use of all there is, to see all that can be seen, to understand all that is intelligible. Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements; whether the elementary exposition of the fundamental principles of a science or an art is the first attempt of a pupil or the masterpiece of a master. See the article Elements of the Sciences.</p>
	<p> But to demonstrate quite convincingly how difficult it is for a single man ever to execute an analytical dictionary of science in general, it suffices to insist upon the mere difficulties of a simple dictionary.</p>
	<p> A universal  dictionary is an opus which proposes to fix the meaning of the terms of a language, by defining those which can be defined, through a short, meticulous, clear, and precise enumeration or the qualities of ideas attached to them. The only good definitions are those that group the essential attributes of the thing designated by the word. But is just anyone capable of knowing and exposing these attributes? Is the art of defining as common as that? Are we not all, more or less, in the same situation as children who apply, with the greatest precision, innumerable terms in the place of which they would be utterly incapable of substituting the correct collection of qualities of ideas they represent? Whence, how many unforeseen difficulties, when it comes to setting down the meaning of the commonest expressions? We constantly experience the fact that the ones we least understand are also those we use the most. What is the reason for this strange phenomenon? It is that we are forever in the situation of pronouncing that a thing is such ; almost never in the necessity of determining what it is to be such . Our most frequent judgments fall on specific objects, and the general usage of the language and experience suffices to guide us. We merely repeat what we have heard all our lives. Such is not the case when we need to form general notions which include, without exception, a certain number of individuals. Only the deepest contemplation and the most surprising breadth of knowledge can guide us surely. Let me clarify these principles with an example: we say of a great many objects of every kind, without any of us ever getting it wrong, that they are luxury items ; but what is this luxury which we attach so unmistakably to so many objects? That is a question one can satisfy with any precision only after a discussion which the persons who demonstrate the greatest accuracy in the application of the word luxury have not held, and are perhaps not prepared to hold.</p>
	<p> All the terms must be defined, except for radicals, that is to say those which designate simple sensations or the most general abstract ideas. See article Dictionary. Should any be omitted, the dictionary is incomplete. Should you wish to exclude none, who will exactly define the word conjugate , if not a geometrician; the word conjugation , if not a grammarian; the word azimuth , if not an astronomer; the word epic , if not a man of letters; the word exchange , if not a merchant; the word vice , if not a moralist; the word hypostasis , if not a theologian ; the word metaphysics , if not a philosopher; the word gouge , if not a man versed in the arts? Whence I conclude that, if the French Academy did not bring together in its assemblies the fully gamut of knowledge and talents, it would be certain to overlook many expressions that will be sought in its dictionary, or let through false, incomplete, absurd, or even ridiculous definitions.</p>
	<p> I am not unaware that this opinion is not that of those men who talk about everything and know nothing; who are not members of our academies; who will never be, because they are not worthy to be; who nevertheless make it their business to pick the candidates for vacant seats; who, daring to set the limits of the French Academy's purpose, were almost indignant to see the likes of Mairans,  Maupertuis, and D'alembert received in its company, and who are not unaware that the first time any of them spoke up there, it was to rectify the definition of the term noon . To listen to them, one would think that they presume to confine the knowledge of the language and the dictionary of the Academy to a very small number of terms familiar to them. Even then, should they look closer, among these terms they would find quite a few, such as tree, animal, plant, flower, vice, virtue, truth, force, law, which if they wished to define them rigorously would leave them no choice but to call on the philosopher, the jurist, the historian, the naturalist; in a word, the man who knows the real or abstract qualities that constitute such an entity, and that specify or individualize it, according to whether there are other entities like it or it is unique.</p>
	<p> Let us then conclude that one will never bring a good dictionary into being without the help of a large number of different talents, because the definitions of names are not different from the definitions of things (see article Definition), and because things can only be well defined or described by those who have long studied them. But if that is the case, what will not be required in order to carry out an opus in which, far from merely attempting to define a word, we shall attempt to describe in detail all of its properties?</p>
	<p> A general analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts cannot, therefore, be the work of a single man . I will go farther: I do not think it can be the work of any of the literary or scientific societies now existing, either separately or collectively.</p>
	<p> The French Academy would furnish to an encyclopedia only that which pertains to the language and its usage; the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, only knowledge relative to profane history, ancient and modern, chronology, geography and literature; the Sorbonne, only theology, sacred history, and superstitions; the Academy of Sciences, only mathematics, natural history, physics, chemistry, medicine, anatomy, etc.; the Academy of Surgery only the art of that name; the Academy of Painting, only painting, engraving, scupture, design, architecture, etc.; the university only what is understood by humanities, the school of philosophy, jurisprudence, typography, etc.</p>
	<p> Survey the other societies I may have omitted, and you will see that, each one being concerned with a particular object,  which doubtless belongs in the purview of a universal dictionary, they leave aside an abundance of others which should be included in it; and none of them will supply you with the breadth of knowledge you require. Go further, and require each of them to make a contribution: you will see how many things are still missing, and you will be obliged to get the assistance of a large number of men who belong to different classes, priceless men, but to whom the gates of the academies are nonetheless closed because of their social station. All the members of these learned societies are more than is needed for a single object of human science; all the societies together are not sufficient for a science of man in general.</p>
	<p> Doubtless what one would obtain from each separate society would be very useful, and what they would supply would greatly advance the universal dictionary towards its realization. There is even one task which would bring their efforts back to the purpose of this enterprise and which should be imposed upon them. I distinguish two means of cultivating the sciences: one is to contribute to the sum of knowledge through discovery, and this is the way one merits the name of inventor  ; the other is to compare discoveries and reorganize them, so that more men are enlightened, and each may participate, according to his abilities, in the enlightenment of his times; and what are called classical authors are those who succeed in this genre, which is not without its difficulties. I concede that, were the learned societies throughout Europe to set themselves to collecting ancient and modern knowledge, connecting it, and publishing complete and methodical treatises, one would only be the better for it; at least let us judge that by its effects. Let us compare the twenty-four quarto volumes of the Academy of Sciences,  compiled in accordance with the prevailing spirit of our most celebrated academies, to eight or ten volumes composed as I conceive the project, and see whether the choice could be in doubt. The latter would contain a huge amount of excellent material dispersed through a large number of studies, where it remains unproductive of any useful sensation, like scattered embers which will never constitute a glowing fire; and of those ten volumes, the most prolific academic collection would constitute at most a few. Have a look at the Mémoires de Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres , and figure how many could be used for a scientific treatise. What can I say of the Philosophical Transactions ,  and the Actes des curieux de la nature ?  In any case, all these enormous collections are precarious; and there is no doubt that the first anthologist with taste and ability will bring them down. Such was to be their ultimate fate.</p>
	<p> Having seriously reflected on it, I find that the specific object of an academician might be to perfect the branch to which he had adhered, and to immortalize himself through writings which would not be those of the academy, which would not be a part of its collections, which he would publish under his own name; but the academy ought to take as its purpose to assemble all that has been written on every subject, synthesize it, illuminate it, concentrate it, order it and publish treatises in which each item would take up only the space it deserves, and would have only the importance that could not be denied it. How many reports, which fatten our collections, would provide not a line for such treatises!</p>
	<p> What an encyclopedia should do is supplement the execution of this project, extended not only to the various objects of our academies, but to every branch of human knowledge: an opus that can only be carried out by a society of men of letters and artists, dispersed, each concerned with his own division, and joined together only by the general interest of humankind, and by a feeling of mutual beneficence.</p>
	<p> I say a society of men of letters and artists in order to assemble every talent. I will have them dispersed, because there is no existing society from which one can draw all the knowledge that is needed, and because, if you wanted the project to be forever in the making and never completed, you could do no better than to create such a society. Each society has its assemblies, the assemblies are separated by intervals of time, they last only a few hours, part of that time is lost in discussions, and the simplest objects occupy months on end; whence it will transpire, as one of the Forty  was saying, who deploys more wit in conversation than many authors in their writings, that when the twelve volumes of the Encyclopedia   have all been published we will still be on the first letter of our dictionary; whereas, he added, if those working on it held encyclopedic sessions, as we hold academic sessions, we would reach the end of our opus while they were still on the first letter of theirs; and he was right.</p>
	<p> I add, men joined together only by the general interest of humankind, and by a feeling of mutual beneficence , because these being the most excellent motivations that can prompt men of good will to action, they are also the most durable. You can take pride personally in what you are doing; you stir yourself up; you undertake for your colleague and friend what no one would attempt for any other consideration; and I dare to say, based on experience, that the outcome of these attempts is certain. The Encyclopedia has assembled its materials in a rather short time. It is not base interest that has united and hastened the authors; they have seen their efforts abetted by most of the men of letters from whom they had reason to expect some assistance; and they have been deterred in their labors only by those who had not the necessary talent to contribute a single good page to them.</p>
	<p> If the government participates in such an opus, it will not get done. It should use its influence only to favor its execution. With a single word, a monarch can make a palace arise from the grass; but a society of men of letters is not like a herd of manual laborers. An encyclopedia cannot be ordered up. It is a labor that must be doggedly pursued rather than launched energetically. Enterprises of this nature are incidentally proposed in courts, by way of conversation; but they never arouse enough interest to avoid being forgotten amidst the tumult and confusion of countless other more or less important matters. Literary projects conceived by the great are like leaves that grow out in the spring, dry up in the fall, and fall in endless succession in the forests, where the nutrients they supply to a few useless plants is their only noticeable effect. Among countless examples of every kind of which I have knowledge, I will cite just one. There was a proposal for experiments on the hardness of wood. The idea was to strip the bark off trees, and let them die standing. They were stripped, died standing, and probably were cut down; in other words, everything was done, except experiments on the hardness of wood. And how could they have been performed? There were to be six years between the time the first orders were given and the final procedures. If the man on whom the sovereign had depended should happen to die, or lose favor, the work is suspended, and never resumed, since a minister does not generally adopt his predecessor's plans, even though they would bring him, if not greater glory, at least rarer glory than that of having initiated them. Individuals hasten to reap the rewards of expenses they have incurred; government is in no such economic hurry. For some reprehensible reason, the prince is dealt with less honestly than his subjects. Men make minimal commitments, and demand the highest recompense. The uncertainty of whether the work will ever be of any utility causes unbelievable indolence among the workers; and to add to the handicaps all the force possible, projects commanded by sovereigns are never conceived in function of utility, but always of the dignity of the person, which is to say that they are overextended, difficulties mount up; to surmount them, men, talents, and time are required in proportion, and ultimately a revolution almost necessarily occurs which proves the fable of the Schoolmaster.  If the average lifetime of man is less than twenty years, that of a minister is less than ten. But it is not only that interruptions are more frequent, they are also even more damaging to literary projects, when the government is running them, than when they are run by individuals. An individual at least picks up the remains of his enterprise: he carefully sets aside materials that may serve at some more favorable moment; he tries to salvage his investment. The monarchical spirit disdains such prudence. Men die, the fruits of their waking nights disappear, and one cannot discover what has become of them.</p>
	<p> But the fact which should lend the greatest weight to the considerations just set forth, is that an encyclopedia , like a vocabulary, has to be begun, continued, and completed within a certain amount of time, whereas sordid self-interest always tries to prolong projects ordered by kings. If one employed for a universal and analytical dictionary the long years which the scope of such an object seems to require, that dictionary would be, thanks to the intervening revolutions, which are scarcely less rapid in the sciences than in the arts or languages, the dictionary of a previous century, just as a vocabulary slowly compiled could only be that of a bygone reign. Opinions grow old and disappear like words; the interest taken in certain inventions wanes by the day, and vanishes; if the project drags out, long discussions of temporary matters will no longer be pertinent; others, whose place is past, will go unmentioned: a problem we have ourselves experienced, even though no great interval has elapsed between the date of this opus and the moment I write.  The reader can perceive the most disagreeable irregularity in a work destined to represent, in proper proportion, the state of things throughout all previous time; important objects stifled; small ones overblown: in a word, the opus will constantly become disfigured in the hands of its workers; it will deteriorate more from the simple passage of time, than it will ever be perfected through their efforts, and become more deficient and weak by virtue of what ought to be shortened, or dropped, or corrected, or added to, than rich from what it will progressively gain.</p>
	<p> What diversity is not daily introduced into the language of the arts, machines, and techniques! If a man spends part of his life in the description of the arts; if, discouraged by this tiring work, he allows himself to be diverted to more entertaining and less useful occupations, and his earlier work remains in its folders, twenty years will not have elapsed before, in lieu of the new and curious things, fascinating by dint of their strangeness, interesting because of their applications, the prevailing taste, or their temporary importance, he will find nothing but incorrect notions, outdated techniques, crude or abandoned machines. In the several volumes he finally composes, there will be not one page that does not require revision; and in the multitude of illustrations he has had engraved, scarcely a figure that does not require redrawing. They are portraits the originals of which no longer exist. Luxury, father of the arts, is like the Saturn of the fable, who took pleasure in destroying his children.</p>
	<p> The revolution may be less pronounced and less noticeable in the sciences and liberal arts than in the mechanical arts; but there is one. If you look at dictionaries of the last century, you will find under the word aberration nothing of what our astronomers mean by this term; on electricity, that productive phenomenon, there will be scarcely a few lines and even then they will be just false notions and old prejudices. How many terms are there in mineralogy and natural history of which one could say as much? If our dictionary had come a little sooner, we would have been liable to repeat with respect to Ear-cockle, a wheat disease , to grain diseases, and their trade, the errors of centuries past, because the discoveries of M. Tillet and the system of M. Herbert are recent.</p>
	<p> When we treat of beings in nature, what better can we do than to list scrupulously all their known properties at the moment when we write? But observation and experimental physics, constantly multiplying phenomena and facts, and rational philosophy, comparing and combining them, extend or contract constantly the boundaries of our knowledge, and consequently introduce variations in the meanings of our established words, render the definitions we had of them inaccurate, false, and incomplete, and even require us to establish new ones.</p>
	<p> But that which will lend the opus an outdated feel, and cover it with scorn, is above all the revolution that will take place in men's minds, and in the national character. Now that philosophy  is rapidly advancing; that it submits all the objects within its jurisdiction to its power; now that its tone is the prevailing one, and we are beginning to shake off the yoke of authority and example to hold to the laws of reason, there exists hardly a single elementary and dogmatic work with which we can be wholly satisfied. We find these productions imitate those of men, and not nature's truth. We dare raise doubts against Aristotle and Plato; and the time has come when works which still enjoy the highest reputation will lose some of it, or will even be forgotten; certain genres of literature which, for want of real life and actual practices to serve as their models, are incapable of an invariable and reasonable poetics, will be neglected ; and others which will remain, sustained by their intrinsic value, will take on an entirely new form . Such is the effect of the progress of reason; progress which will overturn so many statues, and redress some which have been overturned. These are the statues of rare men who have come ahead of their time. We have had, if I may speak thus, contemporaries in the century of Louis XIV .</p>
	<p> Time, which has dulled our taste for questions of criticism and controversy, has made a good part of Bayle's dictionary insipid.  There is no author who has lost so much in certain places, and gained more in others. But if such was the fate of Bayle, think what would have happened to the Encyclopedia of his time. With the exception of Perrault  and a few others, whose merit the versifier Boileau was not in a position to appreciate – La Mothe, Terrasson, Boindin,  Fontenelle – under whom reason and the philosophical or doubting spirit made such progress, there was perhaps not a man who could have written a single page of it which one would deign to read today. For let there be no mistake: there is a great difference between giving birth out of pure genius to a work celebrated by a whole nation which has its moment, its taste, its ideas and its prejudices, and setting forth the poetics of the genre, in accordance with a real and thoughtful knowledge of the human heart, the nature of things, and right reason, which are the same in every era. Genius knows no rules, and yet it never departs from them in its successes. Philosophy knows only the rules founded on the nature of beings, which is immutable and eternal. The last century furnishes us examples; it is up to ours to prescribe the rules.</p>
	<p> The knowledge that was least widespread in the last century is becoming more so by the day. All women who have received some education are able to use with discernment every expression devoted to painting, sculpture, architecture, and letters. How many children are there who can draw, who have learned geometry, who are just as familiar with the language of the arts as with their native language, and who say an agreement, a beautiful form, an agreeable shape, a hypotenuse, a fifth,  a Triton, an arpeggio, a microscope, a telescope, a focus, the same as they would say an opera glass, a sword, a cane, a carriage, or an ostrich feather? Minds are also swept along in another general movement toward natural history, anatomy, chemistry, and experimental physics. The expressions belonging to these sciences are already quite common, and will inevitably become more so. What will result from all this? That even the popular language will change its appearance; it will be extended as our ears become accustomed to the words through the felicitous applications that are made of them. For if one reflects on it, most of these technical words that we use today were at the outset neologisms ; it is usage and time which have removed that equivocal overtone. They were clear, energetic, and necessary. The metaphorical meaning was not far removed from the literal one. They were descriptive. The relations on which the new usage was based were not too farfetched; they were genuine. The figurative sense did not seem a subtlety; moreover, the word was harmonious and flowing. The main idea was linked to others which we never recall without instruction or pleasure. On such bases are founded the fortune of these expressions; and the opposite causes are those of the discredit into which will fall and have fallen so many other expressions.</p>
	<p> Our language is already quite extensive. Like all others, it has owed its formation to need, and its riches to flights of the imagination, to the constraints of poetry, and to the numbers and harmony of oratorical prose. It will make great strides under the power of philosophy; and if nothing halted the advance of the mind, in less than a century an oratorical and poetic dictionary of the century of Louis XIV, or even our own, would contain scarcely two-thirds of the words that will be in use by our descendants.</p>
	<p> In a vocabulary, in a universal and analytical dictionary, in any work designed for the general instruction of men, one must therefore begin by framing one's object from the most extensive dimensions, understand the spirit of the nation, possess a sense of its direction, outpace it, so that it will not leave your work behind, but on the contrary meet up with it ahead; one must determine to work only for the following generations, because the moment of our existence passes, and a great enterprise will barely be completed before the present generation has passed on. But in order to be useful and new for longer, by getting further ahead of the national spirit which is constantly progressing, it is necessary to shorten the duration of the labor by expanding the number of collaborators: a means which moreover is not without its disadvantages, as we shall see further along.</p>
	<p> Yet knowledge does not and cannot become common beyond a certain point. In truth, we do not know what this limit is. We do not know how far a given man can go. We know even less how far the human race would go, what it would be capable of, if it were not halted in its progress. But revolutions are necessary; there have always been revolutions, and always will be; the greatest interval from one revolution to another is known: this cause alone limits the extension of our work. There is a point in the sciences beyond which it is almost beyond their ability to go. When that point is reached, the achievements that remain of that advance are forever a marvel to the entire species. But if the species is limited in its efforts, how would the individual not be in his? The individual has only a certain amount of energy in his faculties, animal as well as intellectual; he only lasts for a time; he necessarily respects cycles of labor and rest; he has needs and passions to satisfy, and is exposed to endless distractions. Whenever all that is negative in these quantities adds up to the smallest possible sum, or all that is positive adds up to the largest, a man applying himself all alone to some branch of human science will take it as far as it can be taken by the efforts of a single individual. Add to the labor of that extraordinary individual that of another, and so forth, until you have filled the interval between one revolution and the one furthest removed, and you will have some notion of what the entire species could achieve, especially if you assume, as favoring its work, a certain number of auspicious circumstances that would have lessened the success had they gone against it. But the general mass of the species is able neither to follow nor to know this progress of the human mind. The highest point of instruction it can attain has its limits: whence it follows that there will be books that will forever be above the common ken of men; others will gradually drop beneath it, and still others will have both fates.</p>
	<p> To whatever level of perfection an encyclopedia may be brought, it is evident from the nature of the work that is will necessarily be in the latter category. There are objects which are in the hands of the people, from which they draw their subsistence, the practical knowledge of which is their constant concern. Whatever treatise one may write about it, there will always come a moment when they know more about it than the book does. There are other objects about which they will remain almost entirely ignorant, because their gains in knowledge are too small and too slow, even if we assumed it is continuous, ever to amount to much enlightenment. Thus both the man of the people and the scientist will always have equally as much to desire and instruction to find in an encyclopedia . The most glorious moment for an opus of this nature would be that which immediately follows some great revolution which has suspended the progress of the sciences, interrupted the labors of the arts, and plunged a portion of our hemisphere back into darkness. What gratitude the next generation following such troubled times would feel for the men who had feared them from afar, and taken measures against their ravages by protecting the knowledge of centuries past! Then you would see (I say this without vainglory, because our Encyclopedia will perhaps never attain the perfection that would earn it such honors) that that great opus would be named along with the monarch under whom it was undertaken, the minister to whom it was dedicated, the powerful who favored its execution, the authors who devoted themselves to it, all the men of letters who took part in it. The same voice that recalled these supporters would not forget to evoke as well the burdens the authors had to bear and the affronts to which they were subjected; and the monument that would be elevated to them would have several sides, which would represent by turns the honors accorded their memory, and the marks of indignation attached to the memory of their enemies.</p>
	<p> But knowledge of the language is the foundation of all these grand hopes; they will remain uncertain, if the language is not fixed and transmitted to posterity in all its perfection; and this object is the first of those it would behoove the encyclopedists to take seriously to heart. We have realized this too late, and this inadvertence has left its imperfection in our entire work. The language side of it has remained weak (I refer to language , and not to grammar); and for this reason it should be the principal subject of an article in which its labor is examined impartially, and the means of correcting its defects are sought. I shall therefore speak about language specifically and as I ought. I shall even venture to invite our successors to give some attention to this piece; and I shall hope that others for whom it is less directly intended will concede its importance and excuse its length.</p>
	<p> The institution of vocal signs to represent ideas, and of characters drawn to represent vocal sounds, was the initial seed of the progress of the human mind. A science or an art is born only through the application of our reflections to reflections previously made, and the comparison of our thoughts, observations, and experiences with the thoughts, observations, and experiences of our peers. Without the double convention which attaches ideas to sounds and sounds to letters, everything would have remained within man and died there; without grammars and dictionaries, which are the universal interpreters between peoples, everything would have remained concentrated within a single nation, and disappeared with it. It is these works which have permitted men's faculties to be compared and combined; they remain isolated without such an intermediary: an invention, however admirable, would have represented nothing more than the power of a solitary genius, or of a particular society, and never the energy of the species. A common idiom would be the sole means of establishing a correspondence that could extend to all parts of the human race, and ally them against nature, to which we must constantly do violence, in both the physical and moral domains. Assume that such an idiom were concerted and its form fixed: notions immediately become permanent; distances of time disappear; different places are contiguous; connections are created between all inhabited places in space in time, and all living and thinking beings are in contact with each other.</p>
	<p> The language of a people furnishes its vocabulary, and the vocabulary is a fairly faithful register of all the knowledge of that people: by merely comparing the vocabulary of a nation at different times, one would get a sense of its progress. Each science has its name; each notion in the science has one as well: everything known in nature is denoted, just as everything that has been invented in the arts, and phenomena, and skills, and instruments. There are expressions both for entities outside ourselves, and for those inside us: both the abstract and the concrete ones have been named, both the particular and the general, the forms and the states, the existences, the successions, and the permanences. We say the universe ; we say an atom : the universe is the whole, the atom is its smallest part. From the general repertory of all causes down to the single being, everything has its sign: that which exceeds all limits, whether in nature or in our imagination; that which is possible and that which is not; that which is neither in nature nor in our understanding, both the infinitesimal and the infinitely great, extended, enduring, or perfect. The comparison of phenomena is called philosophy. Philosophy is practical or speculative: every notion derives either from sensation or from induction; every entity is either in the understanding or in nature: nature is put to use either by the naked sense, or by the sense aided by an instrument. The language is a symbol of this multitude of heterogeneous things: it indicates to the perceptive man how far people had gone in a given science, even in the most distant past. It can immediately be perceived that the Greeks abounded in abstract terms that the Romans did not possess, and that without these terms it was impossible for them to render what others had written about logic, morality, grammar, metaphysics, natural history, etc.; and we have made so much progress in all these sciences that it would be difficult to write about them, either in Greek or in Latin, in the state to which we have advanced them, without inventing a multitude of new signs. This single observation proves the superiority of the Greeks with respect to the Romans, and our superiority with respect to them all.</p>
	<p> In general all peoples, relatively to the progress of the language and taste, go through innumerable minor revolutions, events little noted, which are not recorded: one can detect that they have occurred only from the tone of contemporary authors, one either modified or dictated by passing circumstances. Where, for example, is the attentive reader who, encountering the following in an author: cantus autem et organa pluribus distantiis utuntur, non tantjm diapente, sed sumpto initio á diapason, concinnunt per diapente et diatessaron ; et unitonum, et semitonium, itá ut et quidam putent inesse et diesin quF sensu percipiatur , would not immediately say to himself, we see there the course of our songs, the uncertainty we are in as to the possibility or impossibility of quarter-tone intonation. In other words, they did not know whether the Ancients did or did not possess an enharmonic scale? Did there then remain not a single musical author who could have resolved the difficulty? Were they therefore debating, at the time of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  essentially the same questions concerning melody that we do? And should it be found elsewhere that the authors were deeply divided over the exact enumeration of the sounds of the Greek language; that this matter had provoked very lively disputes, sed talium rerum considerationem grammatices et poetices esse ; vel etiam, ut quibusdam placet, philosophiF , would one not conclude that it was the same with the Romans as with us? Which is to say that, after treating the science of signs and sounds rather superficially, there was a time when the better minds recognized that there was more connection between that science and the science of things than they had at first suspected, and that one could regard such speculation as not at all unworthy of philosophy. This is precisely our situation; and it is by making a repertory in this way of words incidentally invoked, and foreign to the subject specifically treated by an author in whom they characterize only his own insights, his exactitude, and his indecision, that we could arrive at an illumination of the history of the progress of the human mind in earlier centuries.</p>
	<p> Authors sometimes do not themselves notice the impression of things taking place around them; but this impression is none the less real for that. Musicians, painters, architects, philosophers, etc., can have no disputes without the man of letters knowing about them; and reciprocally, no question can be debated in literature, without vestiges of it appearing in those who write on music, or painting, or architecture, or philosophy. They are like the reflections of a diffuse light falling on artists and men of letters, whom it makes glow. I know that their occasional abuse of expressions of which they misgauge the force, reveals that they were not up to date with the philosophy of their times; but the good mind that picks up these expressions, grabs a metaphor here, a new term there, elsewhere a word relative to a phenomenon, an observation, an experiment, or a system, has some perception of the state of prevailing opinions, the general movement that minds were beginning to receive from it, and the coloration they carried in the common language. And that, let it be said in passing, is what makes the authors of Antiquity so difficult to judge in matters of taste. The general persuasion of an opinion, a system, an accepted usage, the institution of a law, the habit of an exercise, etc., supply them with manners of speaking, thinking, rendering: comparisons, expressions, and figures of which the whole beauty could last only as long as the very thing that served as their basis. The thing passed on, and with it the discursive sparkle. Whence it follows that a writer who wishes to guarantee to his works an everlasting charm, cannot be too careful about borrowing his manner of speaking from stylish ideas, current opinions, prevailing systems, the arts in vogue; all these models are in mutation: in preference he will cling to permanent entities, the phenomena of water, earth, and air, the wonder of the universe, human passions, which are ever the same; and such shall be the truth, force, and immutability of his colors, that his works will inspire awe throughout the centuries, despite the disorder of his material, the absurdity of his notions, and all the defects that can be found in them. His particular ideas, his comparisons, metaphors, expressions, and images, by constantly bringing the reader back to nature which he never tires of admiring, will be so many partial truths by which his reputation will be sustained. People will not read him to learn to think; but they will have him in hand day and night to learn from him how to speak well. Such will be his fate, whereas so many works that are dependent only on cold good sense and heavy reasoning will perhaps be much admired, but little read, and will finally be forgotten, once a man gifted with fine genius and great eloquence has gone through them, and brought back into view truths previously austerely dry and repellent, clothed in nobler, more elegant, richer and more appealing garb.</p>
	<p> These rapid revolutions that occur in things humanly instituted, and which will have such influence on the way posterity will judge productions handed down to them, are a powerful motivation for clinging, in an opus such as ours, where examples are often needed, to instances whose beauty is based on permanent models: without this precaution the models will pass, the truth of the imitation will no longer be felt, and the examples cited will cease to appear beautiful.</p>
	<p> The art of communicating ideas through the painting of objects must have naturally been the first to appear; that of communicating them by setting sounds down in letters is too delicate; it must have frightened the genius who first conceived it. Only after long trials did he begin to see that distinctly different sounds were not as numerous as they seemed, and ventured to think he could represent them all with a small number of signs. Yet the first means was not without its advantages, just as the second did not remain without flaw. Painting does not capture the operations of the mind; one would not make out among the objects distributed across a canvas, as when they are expressed in discourse, the linkages that constitute a judgment or syllogism; what makes of one of those entities the subject of a clause; what constitutes a quality of these entities as its attribute; what links the clause to another to turn it into reasoning, and this reasoning to another to make of it a discourse; in short, there are countless things of this nature that painting cannot depict; but it at least displays all those which it does depict: and contrariwise while written discourse denotes them all, it displays none of them. Paintings of beings are always very incomplete; but there is nothing ambiguous about them, because they are the very portraits of objects we have before our eyes. The letters of writing extend to everything, but they are conventional; they signify nothing in themselves. The key to pictures is in nature, and is available to anybody; that of alphabetical letters and their combination is a pact of which the secret has to be revealed; and it can never be entirely revealed, because in the expressions are delicate nuances which remain necessarily indeterminate. Moreover, while painting is permanent, it is only of an instantaneous state. If it undertakes to express the simplest movement, it becomes obscure. If we see Fame on a trophy with her wings extended, holding a trumpet in one hand and in the other a crown held over a hero's head, we cannot tell whether she is bestowing the crown or taking it away: we must look to the story to resolve the ambiguity. On the other hand, whatever the variety of an action, there is always a certain collection of terms to represent it, which one cannot say for any row or group of figures. Add as many of these figures as you like, there will be interruption: the action is continuous, but the figures will only provide it in separate instants, leaving to the viewer's discernement to fill in the voids. There is the same incommensurability between all physical motion and all real representations, as between certain lines and series of numbers. However many new terms are added between one term and another, since these terms always remain distinct and do not touch, leaving an interval between any two of them, they can never correspond to certain known quantities. How can one measure any continuous quantity by a discrete quantity? Similarly, how can one represent a continuous action by images of separate instants? But do not these terms which remain necessarily unexplained in any language, the radicals, correspond rather exactly to those intermediate instants which painting cannot represent? And is it not approximately the same defect in the two cases? We are thus blocked in our project for transmitting knowledge, by the impossibility of making the entire language intelligible. How do we repertory grammatical roots? Once repertoried, how do we explain them? Is it worth our trouble to write for the centuries to come, if we are not in a position to make ourselves understood? Let us resolve these difficulties.</p>
	<p> Here is first my opinion on the manner of identifying radicals. Maybe there is some method, some philosophical system, by means of which one would locate a great number of them: but that system seems to me difficult to invent; and whatever it is, its application seems to me subject to error, because of my well-founded habit of being suspicious of all general rules in matters of language. I would rather implement a technical means, all the more so that this technical means is a necessary consequence of the production of an encyclopedic dictionary.</p>
	<p> First, those who collaborate on this opus must oblige themselves to define everything, without exception. Once that is done, the editor will only have to separate the terms when the same word will be taken for a type in one definition, and for a difference in another: it is evident that the necessity of this double usage constitutes the vicious circle, and is the limit of definitions. When all the words have been repertoried, it will be found by examination that of the two terms which are defined by each other, it is sometimes the more general, and sometimes the less general, which is type or difference; and it is evident that it is the more general one that should be considered one of the grammatical roots. Whence it follows that the number of grammatical roots will be precisely half the number of terms repertoried; for of two definitions of a word, one must be admitted as good and legitimate, in order to show that the other is a vicious circle.</p>
	<p> Next let us consider the manner of fixing the notion of these radicals: it seems to me there is but one means, and still it is not as perfect as one would wish; not that it leaves ambiguity in those cases where it is applicable, but in that there can be cases to which it cannot be applied, however skillfully one goes about it. This means is to relate a living language to a dead one: there is but one dead language which can be an exact, invariable, and common measure for all men now living or who shall live, among those they speak and will speak. As that idiom exists only in authors, it no longer changes; and the effect of that characteristic is that its application is always the same, and always equally known.</p>
	<p> If I were asked which, of the Greek and Latin languages, is to be preferred, I would answer neither; my opinion is that they both should be used: Greek for anything that Latin cannot express, or would not offer equivalent expression for, or one less exacting; I would have Greek serve only to fill in the gaps in Latin, and this simply because familiarity with Latin is more widespread: for I concede that if we were to choose on the grounds of richness and abundance, there would be no hesitation. The Greek tongue is infinitely more extensive and expressive than Latin; it has a plethora of terms which bear the evident imprint of onomatopoeia: countless notions which have signs in that tongue have none in Latin, because it appears the Latins did not rise to any level of speculation. The Greeks had burrowed into all the depths of metaphysics of the sciences, the fine arts, logic, and grammar. With their idiom anything can be said; they have all the abstract terms relative to the operations of the understanding: witness Aristotle, Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Apollonius, and all those who wrote on grammar and rhetoric. In Latin one is often hindered by the lack of expressions: it would have taken the Romans several more centuries to integrate abstractions into their language, at least to judge by the progress they made while still under the discipline the Greeks; for in any case a single man of genius can cause ferment among a whole people, abbreviate the centuries of ignorance, and carry knowledge to a point of perfection with a surprising rapidity. But this observation does not efface the truth I am advancing: for if we count the men of genius, and distribute them over the entire span of centuries past, it is evident that there will be few of them in each nation for each century, and that almost none will be found who has not improved the language. Creative men bear this distinctive trait. Since it is not merely by leafing through the writings of their contemporaries that they find the ideas they need to use in their own writings, but sometimes rather by delving deep into themselves, at other times by bursting outside themselves, and studying more attentively and more profoundly the natures about them, they are obliged, especially at the origin of languages, to invent signs to represent exactly and forcefully what they are the first to discover. It is the fire of the imagination and deep contemplation that enrich a language with new expressions; it is keenness of mind and the severity of dialectic that perfects its syntax; it is the flexibility of the speech organs that makes it more supple; it is the ear's sensitivity that makes it harmonious.</p>
	<p> If we decide to make use of both languages, we will first write the French radical, and beside it the Greek or Latin radical, with the quotation of the ancient author from whom it was taken, and where it is used, according the definition closest to the meaning, force, and other accessory notions which must be determined.</p>
	<p> I say the ancient radical , even though it is not impossible that a primary term, radical and undefinable in one language, may have neither of these characteristics in another: in which case it seems plain to me that with one of these peoples the human mind has made more progress than with the other. We do not yet know, it seems to me, to what extent a language is a rigorous and faithful image of the exercise of reason. What prodigious superiority one nation acquires over another, especially in the abstract sciences and the fine arts, from this single difference! And how far the English are still behind us, on the sole consideration that our language is made, and they are not yet thinking about fashioning theirs! Precision in the exact sciences, taste in the fine arts, and consequently immortality in works in that genre, depend on the perfection of the idiom.</p>
	<p> I have specified citation of the place where the Greek and Latin synonym was used, because a single word often has several meanings; because need, and not philosophy, having dictated the formation of languages, they have had and always will have this common defect; but because a word has but one meaning in a cited passage, and that meaning is certainly the same for all peoples to whom the author is known. Μηνιν ἄειδε, θεα` , etc. Arma virumque cano ,  etc. have but a single translation in Paris or Peking: therefore nothing is so misguided as for a Frenchman who knows Latin to learn English from an English-French dictionary, instead of having recourse to an English-Latin dictionary. Even if the English-French dictionary were written or corrected according to the invariable, common measure, or even based upon great familiarity with the two languages, there would be no way to tell; you would be required at each word to rely on the good faith and insight of your guide or his interpreter, whereas by using a Greek or Latin dictionary, you are enlightened, satisfied, reassured by the application; you compose your own vocabulary thanks to that single means, if there be one, that can replace direct intercourse with the foreign nation whose idiom you are studying. I speak, moreover, from my own experience: this method has worked well for me; I consider it a sure means of acquiring in little time very accurate notions for correctness and vigor. In a word, an English-French dictionary and an English-Latin dictionary are like two men one of whom, in telling you about the dimensions or the weight of a body, would assure you that it weighs or measures, and the other, instead of assuring you of anything, would take a yardstick or scale, and weigh or measure it before your eyes.</p>
	<p> But what shall the recourse of the nomenclator be in those instances where the common measure fails him? I reply that a radical being by nature the sign of a simple, specific sensation, or of an abstract general idea, the instances where a common measure will be wanting cannot but be rare. But in those rare instances, one must absolutely rely on the discrimination of the human mind: we must hope that by dint of seeing an undefined expression employed with the same meaning in a large number of definitions in which this sign will be the only unfamiliar one, its value will soon be surmised. There is in ideas, and consequently in signs (for one is to the other as an object to the mirror that repeats it) a close bond, such a correspondence; each emits a light which they reflect back and forth so intensely that, if you know the syntax, and the faithful interpretation of all the other signs is given, or you have an understanding of all the other ideas that go into a sentence, with a single exception, it is impossible not to succeed in determining the exceptional idea or the unknown sign.</p>
	<p> Known signs are so many given conditions for the solution of the problem; and however brief the discourse or how few terms it contains, it hardly seems that the problem could remain among those which have several solutions. Evidence for this lies in the very small number of places where we fail to understand ancient authors: if those places are examined, it will become clear that the obscurity arises either from the writer himself whose ideas were not precise, or the corruption of the manuscripts, or our ignorance of the customs, laws, mores, or some other such cause; never from the indeterminacy of the sign, whenever that sign has been employed with the same meaning in several different places, as necessarily occurs with a radical expression.</p>
	<p> The most important point in the study of a language is doubtless the knowledge and meaning of its terms. Yet that leaves spelling, and pronunciation without which it is impossible to sense the full merit of harmonious prose and poetry, and which consequently must not be entirely neglected, and that aspect of spelling we call punctuation . It has happened, through alterations in rapid succession in the manner of pronouncing, and corrections which are slowly introduced into the manner of writing, that pronunciation and writing fail to coincide, and although there are among the most civilized peoples of Europe societies of men of letters whose responsibility it is to moderate and change them, and bring them closer together, they end up remarkably far apart; so that of two things one of which has only been invented, at the outset, for the purpose of faithfully representing the other, the latter is no less different from the former than portraits of the same person painted at two widely separated ages. Finally the problem reached such exaggerated proportions that no one dared try to remedy it. We pronounce one language, and write another; and we become so accustomed for the rest of our lives to this oddity that caused such tears when we were children, that if we gave up our bad spelling for one closer to pronunciation, we would no longer recognize the spoken language in its new combination of letters.</p>
	<p> But one must not be stopped by these considerations that are so powerful on the multitude and momentarily. One absolutely must constitute a descriptive alphabet, in which the same sign does not represent different sounds, nor different signs the same sound, nor several signs a vowel or a single sound. Next we must determine the value of these signs for the most rigorous description of the different movements of the speech organs in the production of the sounds attached to each sign; distinguish with the greatest precision sequential movements from simultaneous ones; in a word not shrink from minute detail. Famous authors who have written on ancient languages have not refused to take this trouble for their idiom; why should we not do the same for ours which has its original authors in every genre, is expanding daily, and has practically become the universal language of Europe? When Molière made light of grammarians, he was stepping outside his philosophical character, and he did not know, as Montaigne would have said, that he was slapping the writers he respected the most, on the cheek of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme. </p>
	<p> We have but one means for fixing transitory but purely conventional things: it is to compare them to constant entities; and here there is no constant base other than the organs that do not change, and which, like musical instruments, will yield approximately at all times the same sounds, if we know how to manipulate their tension or length like an artist, and properly direct air into their cavities: the trachea and the mouth form a sort of flute, for which we must constitute the most scrupulous notation. I said approximately , because among speech organs there is not one which has not a thousand times more latitude and variety than is needed to introduce surprising and noticeable differences into the production of a sound. Very strictly speaking, there are perhaps not in all of France two men who have exactly the same pronunciation. We each have our own; nevertheless they are all sufficiently alike so that we often notice no disruptive disparities; whence it follows that if we do not manage to transmit our pronunciation to posterity, we will at least pass on a similar one which the custom of speaking will constantly correct; for the first time one artificially produces a foreign word, pronouncing in accordance with its prescribed movements, the most intelligent man, with the most sensitive ear and the most flexible speech organs, is in the same situation as M. Pereire's pupil.  Forcing every movement and separating every sound by a pause, he resembles an organized robot:  but the speed and boldness he gradually acquires can greatly attenuate this deficiency. Soon he will pass for native-born, even though at the start he was, with respect to a foreign language, in a worse situation than the child with relation to its native tongue, which only the nurse could understand. The sequence of the sounds of a language is not as arbitrary as one imagines; the same can be said of their combinations. If there are sounds that could not follow in succession without great effort for the speech organ, then either they do not occur, or else they are not of long duration. They are purged from the language by euphony, that powerful law which acts continually and universally without any regard for etymology and its defenders, and tends continually to attract beings who have the same organs, the same idiom, the same prescribed movements, and approximately the same pronunciation. Causes which act without interruption always in time prove the most powerful, however weak they are in themselves.</p>
	<p> I shall not disguise the fact that this principle suffers from several problems, among them one very important one which I am going to explain. According to you, I will be told, euphony constantly tends to bring together people having the same pronunciation, especially when the movements of the organs have been determined. And yet the Germans, the English, the Italians, and the French all pronounce variously the verses of Homer and Vergil; the Greeks write Μηνιν ἄειδε, θεα` ,  and there are Englishmen who read mi, nine, a, i, dé, zi, é , Frenchmen who read mé, nine, a, ei, ye, dé, thé, a (ei , as in the first vowel of neige , and ye , as in the last one of paye ; this y is a consonant yeu lacking in our alphabet,  although it exists in our pronunciation). (See M. Duclos's Remarques sur la Grammaire générale et raisonnée) </p>
	<p> But what is singular is that they all admire equally the harmony of this beginning: there is the same enthusiasm, even though there is almost no sound in common. Among the French the pronunciation of Greek varies so much that it is not rare to find two scholars who understand that language very well, and do not understand each other; they are in agreement only on quantity. But quantity, being merely the law of movement of pronunciation, simply accelerating or suspending it, does nothing either for the softness or sharpness of the sounds. One can always ask how it happens that letters, syllables, and words either isolated or in combination should be agreeable to several people who pronounce them diversely. Is it a consequence of the prejudice that favors everything that comes to us from far away, the usual prestige of distance of time or place, the effect of a long tradition? How did it come about that amidst so much Greek and Latin verse, there should not be a single syllable so opposed to the pronunciation of the Swedes or the Polish that they should find it impossible to read it? Is our answer that dead languages have been so polished, that they are composed of such simple, easy, elementary combinations of sounds that in all the living languages where they are employed those sounds constitute the most pleasant and melodious part? That these living languages, undergoing constant improvement, just continually correct their harmony and bring it closer to that of dead languages? In a word, that the harmony of the latter, artificial and corrupted by the particular pronunciation of each nation, is still superior to the real, intrinsic harmony of their own languages?</p>
	<p> I shall answer in the first instance, that this last consideration will be the more convincing as the reader is better informed of the extraordinary care the Greeks had taken to render their language harmonious: I shall not go into details, but only remark in general that there is hardly a single vowel, a single diphthong, a single consonant, whose value is so constant that euphony cannot affect it, either by altering the sound, or by suppressing it; secondly, that although the Ancients took some precautions for communicating to us the values of their letters, they were not nearly as precise or as meticulous as they ought to have been; thirdly, that the scholar who has thorough knowledge of what they have left us, will nonetheless imagine he can bring any reasonable and logical person around to a pronunciation very similar to his own; fourth, that we can perfectly prove to the Englishman that in pronouncing mi, nine, a, i, dé, zi, é , he makes six mistakes in pronunciation in seven syllables. He renders the syllable μῆ by mi ; but an ancient author tells us that sheep when they bleat produce the sound of the η . Are we to say that Greek sheep bleated differently from ours, and said bi, bi , rather than bé, bé ? We read moreover in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, η infrá basim linguF allidit sonum consequentem, non suprá, ore moderaté aperto , movements in no way executed by the person who renders η by i . He renders ει which is a diphthong, by an i , a vowel and single sound. He renders the θ by a z or a gutteral s , whereas it is nothing but an ordinary, aspirate t ; he renders θε by zi , in other words instead of channeling the air strongly toward the center of the tongue to produce the short, closed é , allidit spiritum circá dentes, ore parjm adaperto, nec labris sonitum illustrantibus , or he pronounces the letter i . He renders á by é , in other words allidit sonum infrá basim linguF, ore moderaté aperto ; whereas for the correct pronunciation of this letter á he prescribes spiritum extendere, ore aperto, et spiritu ad palatum vel suprá elato .</p>
	<p> Contrariwise, whoever pronounced these Greek words μñνιν, ἅειδε, θϱὰ as mé, nine, a, ei, ye, dé, thé, a , follows all the rules broken by the English pronunciation. Of this one can become convinced by comparing the Greek letters with the sounds I attach to them, and the movements which Dionysius of Halicarnassus prescribes for each of those letters, in his admirable opus De collocatione verborum . To give an idea of the usefulness of his definitions, I will simply record those of the r and the s . The ρ is produced, he says, lingua extremo spiritum repercutiente, et ad palatum propé dentes sublato ; and the σ, linguâ adductâ suprá ad palatum, spiritu per mediam longitudinem labente, et circá dentes cum tenui quodam et angusto sibilo exeunte . I ask you whether it is possible to satisfy these movements, and give the r and the s other values than those we attach to them. He is not less precise with respect to the other letters.</p>
	<p> But, you may insist, if people today who read Greek comply with Dionysius of Halicarnassus's rules, they will all pronounce that language in the same manner, and just as did the ancient Greeks.</p>
	<p> My answer to this question is a supposition that one cannot reject, however extraordinary it may be in this country: it is that a Spaniard or an Italian eagerly desiring to possess a portrait of his mistress, whom he could not produce before any painter, made the only decision he could: to write down the most extensive and precise description of her he could; he first determined the correct proportion of the entire head; then he went on to the dimensions of the forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, neck; then he went back over each of these parts, and spared nothing so that his words would engrave in the painter's mind the true image he had before his eyes; he neglected neither colors, nor forms, nor anything that characterized her: the more he compared his description with his mistress's face, the better likeness he found it to be; he believed above all that the more tiny details he could pack into it, the less freedom he would leave the painter; he neglected nothing that seemed to him likely to constrain the brush. When he deemed the description complete, he made a hundred copies, which he sent to a hundred painters, instructing each to execute exactly on the canvas what they read on the paper. The painters went to work, and after a while our lover received a hundred portraits, all of which were perfect likenesses of his description, and none of which resembled any other or his mistress. The application of this parable is that, however scrupulous a writer may be in describing the movements of the organ when it produces different sounds, there will always be a latitude, slight in itself, but enormous in relation to the real divisions of which it is capable, and to the perceptible but unmeasurable varieties which will result from these divisions. Nevertheless one cannot infer from this either that such descriptions are utterly useless, because they will never produce more than an approximate pronunciation, nor that euphony, that law to which an ancient language has owed all its harmony, if it exerts a constant pressure, will not tend at least as much to bring us closer to it as to distance us from it. These were two propositions that I needed to establish.</p>
	<p> I will say just one thing about punctuation. There is little difference between the art of reading well and that of punctuating well. The pause of a voice in discourse, and the signs of punctuation in writing, always correspond, indicate equally well the connection or separation of ideas, and complement countless expressions. Therefore it will be useful to determine their number according to the rules of logic, and fix their value through examples.</p>
	<p> Next we need only determine accent and quantity. What little accent  we have, more oratorical than syllabic, is unmeasurable; and our quantities can be reduced to longs, shorts, and some less short; in which it seems to allow fewer variations than that of the Ancients who distinguished as many as four kinds of shorts, if not in versification, at least in prose, which obviously exceeds poetry for the variety of its numbers. Thus they said that in "ὁδóς, ρóδος, τρóπος, Ϛρóφος , the fact that the first vowels are short did not prevent their having perceptibly unequal quantities. But this is another case where we can trust a trained voice to make up for any oversights.</p>
	<p> Here then are the practical and necessary conditions for the language, without which knowledge is not communicated, to be fixed as much as its nature permits us to fix it, and for which it is important to fix it for the principal object of a universal and analytical dictionary. One must possess a descriptive alphabet, accompanied by the meticulous detail of the movements of the speech organs and the change of air in the production of sounds attached to the elementary letter,  and to each syllabic combination of such characters; first write the word using the customary alphabet, and then using the analytical alphabet,  each syllable separated and marked according to quantity; add the Greek or Latin word that renders the French word, only when it is a radical, along with the citation of the location where the Greek or Latin word is used by the ancient author; and if there are different meanings, and among these the word sometimes becomes a radical, fix it the same number of times by the corresponding radical in the dead language; in other words, define it when it is not a radical, for this is always possible, and then the Greek or Latin synonym becomes superfluous. It is apparent how slow, difficult, and thorny this labor is. What experience is required in two or three languages, in order to compare the simple ideas represented by different signs which could have among them a sort of identity, or, still more delicately, clusters of ideas represented by signs that must have the same relation; and in the frequent situations where the semblance of identity cannot be established, what subtlety and taste it takes to distinguish which of the signs can take on proximate meanings; and among the accessory ideas,  those to be retained or dropped. But one must not give up. The academy of La Crusca dispelled some of the difficulties in its dictionary. The French Academy, its membership combining all varieties of knowledge, poets, orators, mathematicians, physicists, naturalists, men of the world, philosophers, military officers, and being quite determined in its elections to consult only its own need for one talent rather than another, for the greater quality of its work, it is unimaginable that it would not follow this general plan, and not make its work indispensably useful to those whose job it will be to improve upon the feeble outline we are publishing.</p>
	<p> The Academy will doubtless not fail to call attention to our gallicisms, or to the different instances where our language happens to violate the laws of general analytical grammar; for an idiomatic expression and a violation of this nature are the same thing. Whence one can see once more that in everything there is but one invariable and common measure, without which we know, can appreciate, or define nothing; that general descriptive grammar is in this case that measure; and that without such grammar, a dictionary of the language lacks a foundation, because there is nothing fixed to which one can refer the problematic instances which come up; nothing that can indicate what the difficulty is; nothing to specify what decision to make; nothing to indicate the reason for choosing among several dissimilar solutions; nothing to interpret usage, to combat or justify it, which are often possible. For it would be a prejudice to believe that the language being the basis of intercourse among men, major flaws can long remain in it, without being perceived and corrected by those whose mind is sharp and whose heart is right. It is therefore likely that violations of the general rule which remain, will be abbreviations, vigorous or euphonic expressions, and other inconsequential ornaments, rather than major corruptions. We speak constantly and write constantly; we combine ideas and signs in countless different ways; we refer all these combinations to the yoke of general syntax; sooner or later we subordinate them to it, however minor may be the consequence of making exceptions; and when this subordination does not occur, it is because we have found an advantage in doing otherwise which it is sometimes difficult to analyze, but it would be impossible to do so without descriptive grammar, analogy, and etymology which I shall call the wings of the art of speaking, as it is said of chronology and geography that they are the eyes of history.</p>
	<p> We will not end our remarks on the language without speaking of synonyms. They could be endlessly multiplied, if we did not begin by seeking some rule to limit their number. In all languages there are expressions that differ only by quite subtle shadings. These nuances are not lost on the orator or the poet who know their language; but they constantly ignore them, the one under the difficult constraints of his art, the other carried along by the harmony of his own. It is this consideration which permits deduction of the general rule we require. One must consider as synonymous only the terms that are so treated in poetry, so as to avoid the confusion that would be introduced into the language by the indulgence we have for the rigor of the rules of versification. One must consider as synonymous only the terms that oratorical art substitutes indiscriminately for each other, so as to avoid the confusion that would be introduced into the language by the charm of the oratorical harmony which sometimes chooses and sometimes eschews the correct word, dispensing with the judgment of good sense and reason, in order to submit to that of the ear: a dispensation which at first appears a most manifest extravagance and most contrary to accuracy and truth; but which becomes, when we think about it, the basis of discrimination, of good taste, of the melody of the style, its unity, and the other qualities of elocution, which alone can assure immortality to literary productions. As the sacrifice of the correct word is never made except on occasions when the mind is not thrown too far off track by the melodious expression, the understanding then compensates for it; the discourse corrects itself, the phrase becomes harmonious; I see the thing as it is; I see in addition the character of the writer, the value he himself puts on the objects of which he speaks, the passion that moves him; the vision becomes more complex, more developed, and the enchantment grows proportionately in my mind; the ear is content, and truth is not offended. When these advantages cannot be conjured, the most harmonious writer, if he possesses exactness and taste, will never allow himself to dispense with the correct word in favor of its synonym. He will use it to strengthen or dampen the melody using some meliorative device; he will vary the tempo, or fool the ear with some other trick. Independently of harmony, the correct word must also be sacrificed to another, whenever the former evokes small, base, or obscene notions, or recalls disagreeable sensations. But in the other circumstances, would it not be more appropriate, it will be said, to leave to the reader the task of supplying the harmonious word rather than the correct one? No, even were it as easy for the ear, after the correct word has been given, to hear the harmonious one, as it is for the mind, after the harmonious word has been given, to find the correct one. If the musical effect is to be produced, then the music must be heard: it cannot be imagined; it is nothing if the ear is not actually affected by it.</p>
	<p> We will repertory indiscriminately all the expressions that our greatest poets and finest orators have used and may use. It is posterity above all which we must have in view. It is in any case an invariable standard. There is no need to shade words one has no tendency to confuse, when the language is dead. Beyond that limit, the art of making synonyms becomes as extensive an occupation as it is childish. I would like to see two other criteria in the distinction of synonymous words. The first is not only to note the concepts that serve to differentiate, but also those that are shared. The abbé Girard  respected only the first part of this rule; however the part he neglected is neither less essential, nor less difficult to fulfill. The second is to choose one's examples in such a way that as the meanings are explained, the national usages, customs, character, vices, virtues, and principal transactions, etc. also be explained; and that the memory of the nation's great men, its misfortunes, and its prosperities, be recalled. It will be no more difficult to make a synonym appear useful, sensible, instructive and virtuous, than make it contrary to honesty or meaningless.</p>
	<p> Let us add to these remarks a simple and reasonable means of shortening the word list and avoiding repetitions. The French Academy had made use of it in the first edition of its dictionary ; and I do not think it would have abandoned it for the benefit of limited readers, if it had considered how easy it was to assist them. This means of shortening the word list is not to distribute through several separate articles that which naturally ought to be contained in a single one. Must a dictionary contain a word as many times as there are differences in the mental perspective? The opus becomes limitless, and will necessarily be a chaos of repetitions. I would therefore make of précipitable, précipiter, précipitant, précipitation, précipité, précipice , and every other similar expression, a single article to which I would refer in all the places where the alphabetical order yielded expressions linked by a single general, common idea. As for the differences, the substantive designates either the thing or the person, or the action, sensation, quality, time, or place; the participle, the action, considered either as possible, or as present or past; the infinitive, the action relative to an agent, a place, and some indeterminate time. To multiply the definitions according to all these variations is not to define the terms; it is to return to the same notions at each new variation a term presents. Is it not evident that what suits an expression considered once under all these different points of view, also suits all those in the language which admit of the same variation? I shall note that for the perfection of an idiom, it is to be wished that the terms should take on all the variation of which they are susceptible , because there are verbs, such as the neutral ones, which exclude certain nuances; thus aller cannot have the adjective allable . But how many others are there of which this is not the case, and of which the production is limited for no reason, despite daily need, and the vexing lack particularly felt by precise and concise writers? We say accusateur, accuser, accusation, accusant, accusé , and we do not say accusable , even though inexcusable is used. How many adjectives are there which do not move toward the noun, and nouns which do not move toward the adjective? There is here a fertile spring from which our language still may draw many riches. It would be a good thing to note for each expression the shadings it lacks, so some contemporary of ours will make bold to supply them, or that for fear that, being fooled later by analogy, people consider them just ways of speaking in use in the right century.</p>
	<p> This is what I needed to say about language. The more that object had been neglected in our work, the more important it was in relation to the goal of an encyclopedia , and the more appropriate it was to go into it here in some detail, were it only, as we have said, to indicate the means of compensating for the mistake we have made. I have not mentioned syntax, nor other parts of French basics; the person whose assignment that was has left nothing to be desired in that domain, and from that angle our dictionary is complete. </p>
	<p> But after treating the language, or the means of communicating knowledge, let us seek the best way of tying it together.</p>
	<p> There is first a general order, that which distinguishes this dictionary from every other work in which the material is likewise subjected to alphabetical order, the order for which it is called Encyclopedia . We will say only one thing about this ordering considered in connection with the whole encyclopedic material, which is that it is not possible for the architect of the most fertile genius to introduce as much variety into the construction of a large edifice, into the decoration of its façades, the combination of its orders,  in short into all the parts of its distribution, as the encyclopedic order allows. It might be created either by relating our different kinds of knowledge to the various faculties of the soul (this is the system we have used), or by relating them to the entities they take as their object; and this object may be one of pure curiosity, or a luxury, or a necessity. Science in general may be divided into science of things and of signs, or into concrete or abstract sciences. The two most general causes, art and nature, also yield an elegant and broad distribution. Others will found in the distinction between the physical and the moral, the extant and the possible, the material and the spiritual, the real and the intelligible. Does not all we know derive from the use of our senses and our reason? Is it not either natural or revealed? Is it not either words, or things, or facts? It is therefore impossible to banish arbitrariness from this broad primary distribution. The universe offers us only individual beings, infinite in number, and virtually lacking any fixed and definitive division ; there is none which one can call either the first or the last; everything is connected and progresses by imperceptible shadings; and if throughout this uniform immensity of objects, some appear, which like the tips of rocks seem to break through the surface and rise above it, they owe this prerogative only to particular systems, vague conventions, certain unrelated events, and not to the physical arrangement of beings and to nature's intention. See the Prospectus. </p>
	<p> In general the description of a machine can begin with any part at all. The larger and more complicated the machine, the more connections there are between its parts, the less we know these connections, the more different perspectives for description there will be. What then if the machine is in every sense infinite; if we are speaking of the real universe and the intelligible universe, or a work which is like the imprint of both? Either the real or the intelligible universe has infinite points of view from which it can be represented, and the possible systems of human knowledge are as numerous as those points of view. The only one from which arbitrariness is excluded, as we said in our Prospectus , is the system which has existed from all eternity in the will of God. And the one following which we might have descended from that prime eternal being to all the beings which over time emanated from within it would resemble the astronomical hypothesis in which the philosopher is transported in thought to the center of the sun, to calculate from there the phenomena of the celestial bodies about it: an organization which has simplicity and grandeur, but which could be criticized for a serious defect in a work written by philosophers, and addressed to all men in all times: the defect of being too closely tied to our theology, a sublime science, doubtless useful for the knowledge the Christian receives from it, but even more useful for the sacrifices it requires and the recompenses it promises.</p>
	<p> As for this general system from which arbitrariness is excluded, and which we shall never possess, perhaps there would be little advantage for us in possessing it: for what difference would there be between the reading of an opus in which all the mechanics of the universe were expounded, and study of the universe itself? Almost none: we would still be able to understand only a portion of that great book; and should the impatience and curiosity which rule us and so frequently interrupt the course of our observations, introduce disorder into our readings, our knowledge would become as fragmented as they are; losing the chain of inductions, and ceasing to perceive previous and subsequent relations, we would soon have the same gaps and the same uncertainties. Now we are busy filling in the gaps by studying nature; we would then be busy filling them by contemplating an immense volume which, being in our eyes no more perfect than the universe, would be no less exposed to the temerity of our doubts and objections.</p>
	<p> Since the absolute perfection of a universal plan would not compensate for the weakness of our understanding, let us focus on what is appropriate to our human condition, and be content with going back to some very general notion. The higher the viewpoint from which we consider objects, the greater expanse it allows us to see, and the more the order we follow will be instructive and grand. Consequently it must be simple, because there is rarely grandeur without simplicity; it must be clear and accessible; it must not be a tortuous labyrinth where we might become lost, and in which we can perceive nothing from the point where we are; but a broad, vast avenue which extends into the distance, along which others are encountered at intervals, leading to remote and isolated objects via the easiest and shortest path.</p>
	<p> One consideration above all must not be lost sight of, and that is that if man or the thinking, observing being is banished from the surface of the earth, this moving and sublime spectacle of nature is nothing but a sad and silent scene. The universe is dumb; silence and night overtake it. Everything changes into a vast solitude where unobserved phenomena occur in a manner dark and mute. It is the presence of man that gives interest to the existence of beings; and what could we better have in view in the history of those beings,  than to yield to this consideration? Why not introduce man into our opus, as he is placed in the universe? Why not make of him a common center? Is there some point in infinite space from which we could more advantageously originate the immense lines which we propose to extend to all other points? What stirring and agreeable reaction of those beings towards man, and of man toward them, would not result?</p>
	<p> This is what has led us to seek in the principal faculties of man, the general division to which we have subordinated our labors. One may follow some other path if he prefers, provided he not put in place of man some silent, insensitive and cold being. Man is the sole point from which to begin, and to which all must be brought back, if we are to please, engage, and affect the reader even in the most arid considerations and driest details. Aside from my existence and the happiness of my peers, what does the rest of nature matter?</p>
	<p> A second order not less essential than the previous one, is that which will determine the relative length of the different sections of the work. I admit that there arises at this point one of those difficulties which it is impossible to overcome at the outset and difficult to overcome no matter what the ultimate form of the publication. How does one establish a proper proportion between the different sections of a such a great whole? Even if it the whole thing were the work of a single man, that task would not be easy; what does it then become, when the whole is the work of a numerous society? If we compare a Universal and analytical dictionary of human knowledge to a colossal statue, it does not help, since we know neither how to determine the absolute height of the colossus, nor by what sciences or what arts its different members should be represented. What material shall serve as its standard unit? Shall it be the noblest, the most useful, the most important, or the most extensive? Shall we choose morality over mathematics, mathematics over theology, theology over jurisprudence, jurisprudence over natural history, etc.? If we hold to certain generic expressions which no two people understand in the same manner, although everyone uses them without contradiction, because one is never explicit about it; and if we ask of each contributor either elements, or a complete, general treatise, we shall soon discover how vague and indeterminate that nominal measure is. And he who thinks he has taken sufficient precautions with his various colleagues so that the materials he will get from them more or less fit in with his plan, is a man who has no idea of his object, nor of the colleagues he had enrolled. Each has his manner of feeling and seeing. I remember how an artist  to whom I thought I had laid out quite exactly what he needed to do for his art, brought me in accordance with my instructions, or so he claimed, on the manner of hanging wallpaper, which required about two pages of writing and a half-plate illustration, ten or twelve enormous plates covered with drawings, and three thick folio copybooks written in a very small hand, enough to fill one or two volumes in-12º. Contrariwise, another, to whom I had prescribed exactly the same rules as to the first, brought me, on one of the most extensive manufactures in terms of the variety of products it turns out, the materials it uses, the machines it employs, and the operations performed, a small catalogue of words undefined, unexplained, unillustrated, assuring me quite firmly that his art contained nothing more: he assumed that the rest either was not unfamiliar, or could not be written. We had hoped to get from one of our most talked-about connoisseurs the article Composition (Painting) (M. Watelet had not yet offered us his assistance). We received from him two lines of definition short on precision, style, and ideas, with the humiliating admission that that was all he knew ; and it was I who had to do the article Composition (Painting), I who am neither a connoisseur nor a painter.  These phenomena hardly astonished me. Nor was I more surprised at the same diversity between the labors of scientists and men of letters. The proof can be found in a hundred places in this work. Here we are bloated and exorbitantly fat; there we are lean, petty, pathetic, dry, and scrawny. In one place, we are skeletal, in another we rather seem dropsical; we are by turns dwarves and giants, colossuses and pygmies; standing straight, nicely built and well proportioned; hunchbacked, lame and deformed. Add to all these quirks that of a text which is sometimes abstract, recondite or mannered, more often careless, drawn-out, and diffuse; and you will compare the work to a monster of the poetic art, or even to something more hideous yet. But these defects are inseparable from a first attempt, and it is clear to me that only time and centuries to come can correct them. If our descendants attend to the Encyclopedia without interruption, they will be able to bring the organization of its material to some degree of perfection. But without a common and constant measure, there is no middle ground: one must at first allow without exception for everything a science embraces, leave each topic to itself, and prescribe no limits other than those of its object. Each thing thus being in the Encyclopedia what it is in itself, it will have its true proportion, especially when time has compressed knowledge, and reduced each subject to its proper length. Should it happen that after a large number of successive revised editions, some important topic remains in the same state, as among us could easily be the case of mineralogy and metallurgy, it will not be the fault of the work, but of the human race in general, or of the nation in particular, whose attention has not yet turned toward those objects.</p>
	<p> I have frequently made one observation, which is that the emulation  which is necessarily kindled among colleagues produces dissertations instead of articles. In such cases, the whole art of referencing  cannot counter the effect of diffusion; and instead of reading an article of the Encyclopedia , you find yourself reading a report for an academy. This defect will lessen with subsequent editions; knowledge will necessarily converge; the bombastic, oratorical tone will abate; some discoveries having become more common and less interesting will occupy less space; then only the new materials, the discoveries of the day will be inflated. It is a sort of deference that will always be shown for the object, the author, the public, etc. Once the moment has passed, that article will be subject like the others to circumcision. But as in general new inventions and ideas introduce inevitable disproportion, and the first edition is, of all, the one containing the most things if not recently invented, as least as little known as if they were, it is evident from this reason as well as the previous one, that it is the edition in which the greatest disorder will prevail; but which on the other hand will manifest through its irregularities an appearance of originality that is not likely to pass into later editions.</p>
	<p> Why is the encyclopedic order so perfect and regular in the English author?  Because since he limited himself to compilation from our dictionaries and the analysis of a small number of works, invented nothing, and stuck strictly to what was known, everything being equally interesting or indifferent to him, having neither a preference for any topic, nor favorable or unfavorable time for work, save that of a migraine or spleen, he was a laborer who plowed his furrow, shallow, but even and straight. Such is not the case with our opus. We have our pride. We want our set-pieces. Such is perhaps my vanity at this moment. One person's example attracts another. The editors object, but in vain. Their own mistakes are held up to them, and everything inclines to excess. Chambers' articles are fairly regularly distributed; but they are empty. Ours are full, but irregular. If Chambers had filled his up, I have no doubt his organization would have suffered.</p>
	<p> A third order is that which sets forth the distribution particular to each section. That is the first document we will require of a colleague. This order does not seem to me entirely arbitrary: in this respect a science is not like the universe. The universe is the infinite work of God. A science is a finite work of human understanding. There are first principles, general notions, given axioms. These are the roots of the tree. The tree must ramify as much as possible; it must shoot off from the general object as from a trunk, rise first to the large branches or primary divisions; go on from these master branches to smaller ones; and so on, until it has reached out to the particular terms which are like the leaves and crown of the tree. And why should this detail be impossible? Has not every word its place, or, if it can be put this way, its stem and its point of attachment? All these individual trees will be carefully harvested; and to present the same ideas in a more precise image, the general encyclopedic order will be like a world map on which will be seen nothing but broad regions; particular orders, like maps of particular kingdoms, provinces, countries; the dictionary, like the geographical, detailed history of all places, the general and analytical topography of all we know in the intelligible world and the visible world; and the references will serve as itineraries in these two worlds, of which the visible one may be regarded as the old world, and the intelligible one as the new world.</p>
	<p> There is a fourth order, less general than any of the preceding, and it is that which appropriately distributes several different articles subsumed under a single label. Here it appears necessary to respect the generation of ideas, the analogy of topics, their natural interconnections, to go from the simple to the figurative, etc. There are isolated terms which are proper to a single science, and should cause no special concern. As for those whose meaning varies and which belong to several sciences and several arts, we must make them into a small system the object of which is to dampen and palliate as much as possible the strange array of discordances. We must compose a whole as minimally irregular and disparate as we can, being guided sometimes by relationships, when they are strong, and sometimes by the importance of the topics; and failing relationships, by original turns that the editors will come up as frequently as their genius, imagination, and knowledge allow. There are topics which cannot be separated, such as sacred and profane history, theology and mythology; natural history, physics, chemistry and some arts, etc. The science of etymology, the historical knowledge of entities and names, will also furnish a large number of different views which one can always follow without fear of being confused, obscure, or ridiculous.</p>
	<p> In the midst of these different articles of the same label to be distributed, the editor will proceed as if he himself were the author; he will follow the order he would have followed if he had to treat the word with all its meanings. In this there is no general rule to prescribe; if we knew one, the least disadvantage of following it would be the dreariness of uniformity. The general encyclopedic order would occasionally give rise to bizarre arrangements. Alphabetic order would constantly cause comical contrasts; a theological article would be plunked down in the middle of the mechanical arts. What we can all do, and without disadvantage, is to begin with the simple, grammatical meaning; sketch out under the grammatical meaning an abbreviated chart of the article as a whole; present as examples as many different expressions as there are different meanings; organize these expressions as the different meanings of the word are to be organized in the rest of the article; at each expression or example, refer to the particular meaning in question. Then we will almost invariably see logic follow grammar, metaphysics follow logic, theology follow metaphysics, morality follow theology, jurisprudence follow morality, etc.; despite the disparity of meanings, each article treated in this manner will form a whole; and despite this uniformity which all articles will have in common, there will be neither too much uniformity, nor monotony. I insist on the freedom and variety of such a distribution, because it is at once convenient, useful, and reasonable. The composition of an encyclopedia is like the founding of a large city. All the houses ought not to be constructed on the same model, even were a general model found, attractive in itself and suited to any site. The uniformity of buildings, by leading to the uniformity of the public arteries, would make the whole city appear sad and wearisome. People who walk cannot fail to be bored by a long wall, or even a long forest with which they were at first enchanted.</p>
	<p> A good mind (and we must assume this quality in an editor) will manage to put each thing in its place, and there is no reason to fear that his own thoughts are sufficiently disordered, or his taste sufficiently poor, to mix disparate meanings for no good reason. But it would also be unjust to blame him for vagaries that would only be the necessary consequence of the diversity of topics, the imperfections of the language, and the misuse of metaphors, which transport a single word from an artisan's shop to the benches of the Sorbonne, and lump the most dissimilar things under a single label.</p>
	<p> But whatever object is being treated, it is necessary to designate the category it belongs to; its specific difference, or the quality that distinguishes it, if there is one; or rather the cluster of those which constitute it (for from such a cluster results a necessary difference, for otherwise, there being two or more physical entities which are absolutely the same to our judgment and senses, we could not tell them apart); its causes, when they are known; what we know of its effects; its active and passive qualities; its operation; its object; its uses; whatever appears unusual about it; its generation; its growth; its vicissitudes; its dimensions; its demise, etc., whence it follows that the same object considered from so many points of view must often belong to several different fields of knowledge, and that a word taken under a single meaning will furnish several articles. If, for example, the subject is some mineral substance, it is commonly the grammarian or the naturalist who first addresses it; he passes it on to the physicist, who in turn gives it to the chemist; the chemist to the pharmacist; the pharmacist to the physician, the cook, the painter, the tanner, etc.</p>
	<p> Whence arises a fifth order which will be all the easier to establish: that the colleagues have remained rigorously within the bounds of their own sections, and well delineated the standpoint from which they were to consider the individual item in question. A methodical, analytical enumeration of its qualities will determine this fifth and last order which also will lend itself to great variety. The sequence of operations through which a substance is passed, according to the use for which it is destined, will suggest the position which each notion should occupy. Besides, I think it necessary to allow each colleague to express himself separately. The editors' work would be endless, if they had to meld all the articles into a single one; moreover it is better to leave to each the honor of his labor, and to the reader the convenience of consulting only the portion of the article he needs.</p>
	<p> I require only that there be method, whatever it be. I would hope that not a single crucial article would be without division and subdivision. Order provides relief to memory. But it is unlikely that an author will take this care for his reader without its turning to his own advantage. Only by long contemplation of the topic does one find a general distribution. It is almost always the last important idea one encounters. It is a single thought that develops, extends, and ramifies, feeding on all the others which come into relation with it as if by themselves. Those that resist this kind of attraction, are either too distinct from its sphere, or have some more considerable defect; and in both cases, it is appropriate to reject them. Besides, a dictionary is made to be consulted; and the essential point is that the reader should take away clearly in memory the product of his reading. One process which must sometimes be accepted, because it represents rather well the method of invention, is to begin with individual and particular phenomena so as to mount from there to more extensive and less specific knowledge; from there to yet more general knowledge, until one reaches the science of axioms or those propositions whose simplicity, universality, and obviousness renders undemonstrable. For in whatever subject area, the whole field has not been covered until you have reached a principle that can neither be proven, nor defined, nor elucidated, nor obscured, nor denied, without losing some of the light it had been able to shed, and taking a step towards the darkness which in the end would become quite dark, if no limit were set to the argumentation.</p>
	<p> If I think there is a point beyond which it is dangerous to continue the argumentation, I also think one should not stop until one is sure it has been reached. Each science and each art has its metaphysics. This aspect is always abstract, lofty, and difficult. Yet that must be the principal aspect of a philosophical dictionary; and it could be said that as long as some such ground remains to be broken, there are unexplainable phenomena, and vice versa. Then the man of letters, the scientist, and the artist walk in darkness; if they make some progress, it is only thanks to chance; they arrive like a lost traveler who follows the right path without realizing it. It is therefore of the utmost importance to set forth the metaphysics of things, or their first and general reasons; the rest will be the more luminous for it and better assured in the mind. All the supposed mysteries for which some sciences are so criticized, and which some others so often cite to mitigate their own, when discussed metaphysically vanish like phantoms of the night on the approach of dawn. Art enlightened from the start will advance surely, rapidly, and always on the shortest path. We must thus take care to give the reasons of things, when there are some; assign the causes, when we know them; indicate the effects, when they are certain; resolve the conundrums through direct application of the principles; set forth truths; unmask errors; artfully discredit prejudices; teach men to doubt and wait; dispel ignorance; weigh the value of human knowledge; distinguish between true and false, true and plausible, plausible and miraculous or incredible, common phenomena from extraordinary phenomena, certain facts from doubtful facts, and those from facts absurd and counter to the natural order; become acquainted with the general course of events, and take each thing for what it is, and consequently inspire a desire for knowledge, a horror for lies and vice, and a love for virtue; for whatever has not happiness and virtue as its ultimate end is nought.</p>
	<p> I cannot bear to see someone rely on the authority of authors in questions of reason; for what use is it in truth to look for the name of an author who is not infallible? Above all, no verse: it seems so feeble and paltry in the middle of a philosophical discussion. Pretty ornaments must be relegated to articles on literature; there I can approve of them, provided they are placed with taste, serve as examples, and either make the flaw that is being censured stand out, or brilliantly illustrate the that is being recommended.</p>
	<p> In scientific treatises, it is the relations of ideas or phenomena which provide direction; as you advance, the subject matter develops, becoming either more general or more particular, according to the method chosen. The same will be true with respect to the general form of an article for the Encyclopedia article, except that the dictionary or coordinated articles have advantages which in a scientific treatise can be achieved only at the expense of some quality; and it will owe these advantages to the references, the most important aspect of encyclopedic ordering.</p>
	<p> I distinguish two types of references: material and verbal. Material references illuminate the object, indicate its closest connections to others immediately related to it, and its distant connections with others that might have seemed remote from it; recall to mind common notions and analogous principles; strengthen consequences; bind the branch to the trunk, and lend to the whole the unity that so favors the establishment of truth and persuasion. But when required, they will have the opposite effect: they will counter notions; bring principles into contrast; covertly attack, unsettle, or overturn some ridiculous opinions which one would not venture to disparage openly. If the author is impartial, they will always have the double function of confirming and refuting, disrupting and reconciling.</p>
	<p> There would be much art and a considerable advantage in these latter references. The entire opus would gain from them internal force and unseen utility, the silent effects of which would necessarily be perceptible over time. Whenever a national prejudice commands respect, for example, that particular article ought to set it forth respectfully, and with its whole retinue of plausibility and persuasion; but at the same time it ought to overturn an edifice of muck, dispel a vain pile of dust, by referring to articles in which solid principles form a basis for contrary truths. This means of undeceiving men acts very quickly on good minds, and ineluctably and without any disagreeable consequence, silently and without scandal, on all minds. It is the art of tacitly deducing the boldest consequences. If such confirming and refuting references are foreseen well in advance, and skillfully prepared, they will give an encyclopedia the character which a good dictionary ought to possess: that of changing the common mode of thinking. The opus which will produce this great general effect will have defects of execution; that I concede. But its plan and fundament will be excellent. The work which has no such action will be poor. Whatever good may otherwise be said of it, the praise will fade away, and the work will be forgotten.</p>
	<p> The verbal references are most useful. Every science and every art has its language. Where would we be, if every time the term proper to an art is used, we were compelled for the sake of clarity to repeat its definition? What repetition! And can we doubt that so many digressions and parentheses and such tedium would make things obscure? It is as common to be verbose and obscure as obscure and dense; and if one of these is sometimes tiresome, the other is always tedious. What we must do, when we use such words without explaining them, is to be extremely careful to refer to the locations that deal with them, to which one would be steered only by analogy, a kind of thread that not everyone can follow. In a universal dictionary of the sciences and arts, we may be constrained in numerous circumstances to presuppose judgment, cleverness, and insight; but there are none in which we should presuppose knowledge. Let the man without intelligence complain, if he so wishes, of the unyieldingness of nature, or of the difficulty of the subject matter, but not of the author, if everything he needs in order to understand has been provided, from either the material or verbal point of view.</p>
	<p> There is a third sort of references which must be neither over-used nor excluded: those which by juxtaposing certain relationships in the sciences, analogous qualities in natural substances, or similar operations in the arts, would lead either to new, speculative truths, or to the perfecting of the known arts, or to the invention of new ones, or to the restitution of ancient, lost arts. Such references are the work of a man of genius. Happy is he who is able to spot them. He possesses the spirit of combination, the instinct which I have defined in some of my Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature .  But it is still better to risk fanciful conjectures than to allow useful ones to be lost. And for this reason I make bold to propose those that now follow.</p>
	<p> Might one not suspect, on the basis of the inclination and declination of the magnetized needle, that its extremity in its complex motion describes a small ellipse similar to that described by the extremity of the Earth's axis?</p>
	<p> On the basis of the very rare instances where nature offers us isolated phenomena that are permanent, such as the ring of Saturn, might one not recover them for the general and common law, by considering that ring, not as a continuous body, but as a certain number of satellites moving in the same plane, at a speed which can cause our eyes to perceive a permanent, uninterrupted sensation of shadow and light? I leave these conjectures to the appreciation of my colleague M. d'Alembert. </p>
	<p> Or, to come to objects closer to hand, and having a more certain practical value: why should we not design figures of plants, birds, animals and men, in other words tableaux, on the looms of silk weavers, where already such perfectly shaded flowers and leaves are being designed?</p>
	<p> Why should it not be possible on the same looms to fill the background of the woolen tapestries made by needle, leaving only the space of the design to be detailed, empty and ready for hand completion, either in wool or in silk? This would offer the same rapidity of execution for such works on the loom, as on the hosiery machine for making stitches.  I invite artisans to reflect on that.</p>
	<p> Could one not extend the minor art of printing with drilled characters to the printing or copying of music? The ruled paper would be available. The staves of the paper would thus be traced onto the small blades of the characters. By using these lines and even the open parts of the characters, these characters could easily be aligned on the staves. The bars separating the measures, those that tie the notes together, and all the other musical signs would be among these characters. The blades could be given widths varying with the notes' values; consequently the notes would occupy on the stave a space proportional to their value, and the measures would correspond rigorously with all the others, on other staves, without the least attention on the musician's part. Once that is done, you would have a frame holding each stave, which would then be applied in turn to as many different sheets of paper as desired, which would yield an equal number of copies of the same piece. The only care that must be taken, would be to raise or lower with a small instrument the little blades which move amongst themselves, in those places where they do not correspond as exactly as they need to, either to the lines, or to the spaces between them.  I shall leave the judgment of this thought to my friend M. Rousseau. </p>
	<p> Finally, a last type of reference, which can be either material or verbal, is that I would willingly call satirical or epigrammatic: such, for example, is one to be found in one of our articles where, following some pompous praise, one reads: see Cowl. The farcical word capuchon , and what one finds in the article Capuchon, could lead one to suspect that the pompous praise was merely ironic, and that the article needs to be read cautiously, carefully weighing the terms employed.</p>
	<p> I would not wish to omit such references entirely, because sometimes they are useful. They can silently target certain kinds of foolishness, as can philosophical references against certain prejudices. It is sometimes a subtle and delicate means of fending off slanders, virtually without taking the defensive, and unmasking grave personalities qui curios simulant et bacchanalia vivunt .  But I do not like them to be frequent; I do not even like the one I have cited. Frequent allusions of this nature would shroud a work in darkness. Posterity, which is unaware of petty circumstances that are unworthy of being passed on, no longer senses the shrewd appropriateness, and views these words that amuse us as childishness. Instead of producing a serious, philosophical dictionary, we descend into triviality. All things considered, I would rather the truth be stated unambiguously, and that, if by misfortune or chance we are pitted against men who are dishonored, ignorant, and immoral, whose name has practically become a dishonest word, we should abstain from naming them out of shame or charity, or else we should fall on them with with no holds barred, scold them ignominiously for their vices, remind them brutally of their station and duties, and pursue them with the bitterness of Persius  and the bile of Juvenal or Buchanan. </p>
	<p> I know it is said of authors who have given full vent to their indignation: This is terrible! People should not be treated so harshly! These are crude insults not worth reading , and other similar words which have been uttered at all times about all works in which ridiculousness and viciousness have been depicted most powerfully, and which we read today with the greatest pleasure. Let us explain this contradiction in our judgments. At the moment when these woeful productions were published, all the wicked, in alarm, feared for their safety: the more wicked the man, the louder he complained. To the satirist he protested the age, station, and dignity of the person, and a host of petty and local considerations which fade by the day and disappear by the end of the century. Do you think that when Juvenal delivered Messalina to the porters of Rome, and Persius took a lowly lackey, and transformed him into a grave personage, a respectable magistrate, the legal profession in the one case, and gallant ladies in the other, did not cry out, saying that those barbs were horribly and criminally indecent? If you don't think so, you are wrong. But the momentary circumstances are forgotten; posterity sees only the folly, the ridiculousness, the vice and viciousness, covered with ignominy, and delights in it as an act of justice. He who censures vice lightly to me is not friend enough of virtue. One is the more indignent at injustice as one is farther from committing it; and it is a reprehensible weakness that prevents us from showing for cruelty, baseness, envy, duplicity, the deep and powerful loathing that every honest man must feel.</p>
	<p> Whatever the nature of references, there cannot be too many of them. It is better there be too many than that any be overlooked. One of the most immediate effects, and of the most important advantages of the multiplicity of references, will be first , to perfect the word list. An essential article is related to so many other articles that it would be nearly impossible for one among the laborers not to have referenced them. Whence it follows that it cannot be forgotten; for a word which is merely accessory in one subject matter is the important one in another. But this is true in the material as well as the verbal. One person mentions a phenomenon, and refers to the articles specific to that phenomenon; another a quality, and refers to the substantive article; this one a system, that one an operation, and each one makes his reference to the appropriate location, not because of what it contains, for he has not seen a copy of it, but on his presumption of what it must contain, to illuminate and complement the article on which he is working. Thus at every moment grammar will refer to dialectic, dialectic to metaphysics, metaphysics to theology, theology to jurisprudence, juridprudence to history, history to geography and chronology, chronology to astronomy, astronomy to geometry, geometry to algebra, algebra to arithmetic, etc. One extremely important precaution is not to think so highly of one's colleague as to think he will have overlooked nothing. There are so many other reasons besides bad faith, either to get an article by, or for not treating everything that the object includes, that one cannot be too careful in referring to it.</p>
	<p> It is, secondly , to avoid repetitions. Every science overlaps with others: they are two continuous branches off a single trunk. He who composes an opus does not enter abruptly into his subject, does not close himself strictly within it, does not leave it abruptly: he is obliged to anticipate terrain adjoining his; its consequences often take him onto another contiguous terrain on the opposite side; and how many other excursions are necessary in the body of the work? What is the purpose of the forewords, introductions, prefaces, exordia, episodes, digressions, and conclusions? If we separated scrupulously from a book what is outside the subject it treats, we would almost always reduce it to a quarter of its volume. What does the encyclopedic linkage do? Just that harsh division. It sets the limits of a subject so firmly that there remains in an article only what is essential. A single new idea generates volumes under the pen of a writer; those volumes reduce to a few lines under the pen of an encyclopedist. We are subjected unawares to what is strictest and most precise in the geometricians' method. We progress rapidly. One page always presents something different from the preceding or subsequent page. The need of a proposition, a fact, an aphorism, a phenomenon, a system, requires no more than a single citation in an encyclopedia , just as in geometry. The geometrician refers from one theorem or problem to another, and the encyclopedist from one article to another. And so it is that two types of opus, which seem so very different in nature, come by the same means to create a most dense, tightly knit, and continuous whole. What I say is so precisely true that the method by which mathematics is treated in our dictionary is the same followed for other topics. From this point of view there is no difference between an article on algebra and an article on theology.</p>
	<p> Thanks to encyclopedic ordering, the universality of knowledge, and the frequency of references, the connections grow, the links go out in all directions, the demonstrative power is increased, the word list is complemented, fields of knowledge are drawn closer together and strengthened; we perceive either the continuity or the gaps in our system, its weak sides, its strong points, and at a glance on which objects it is important to work for one's own glory, or for the greater utility to humankind. If our dictionary is good, how many still better works it will produce!</p>
	<p> But how will an editor ever verify these references, if he does not have his whole manuscript in front of him? This condition seems to me so important that I will pronounce that he who has the first sheet of an encyclopedia printed, without having read his copy twenty times over in advance, does not realize the extent of his functions; that he is unworthy of directing such a lofty enterprise; or that bound, as we have been, by unforeseeable events, he found himself suddenly engaged in this labyrinth, and constrained by honor to extricate himself as best he could.</p>
	<p> An editor will never give to the whole a certain degree of perfection, if he only gets the various sections successively. If that happens it would be harder to judge the overall universal dictionary, than the general ordering of a piece of architecture, of which only the separate parts could be seen one after the other. How could there not be references overlooked? How many useless, or false, or ridiculous ones will fail to escape him? An author inserts a reference by way of proof, at least that is his intention, and it happens that what he refers to is an objection. The article which another has cited, either will not exist at all, or will include nothing analogous to the topic at issue. Another drawback is that a part of the manuscript may be missing only because the author has been writing as the work was being printed; whence it will occur that, abusing references to consult his leisure or listen to his sloth, the subject matter will be ill distributed, the first volumes lacking it altogether, the last ones overloaded, and the natural order entirely distorted. But there is worse to fear, which is that the laborer, overwhelmed at the end by a prodigious number of articles referred from one letter to the next, will mangle them, or even not do them at all, putting them off for a later edition. He will hesitate all the less to take this latter path, that by then the fortune of the work will be made, or it will not happen. But what a dilemma will we not face if it happens that the colleague who advances his work only for the next printing, dies or falls victim to a long illness! Experience has unfortunately taught us to fear such events, although the public has not yet noticed them.</p>
	<p> If the editor has his entire manuscript in hand, he will take a section of it, and follow it in all of its ramifications. It will either contain everything that enters into its object, or it will be incomplete; if it is incomplete, it is most unlikely he will fail to be alerted to the omissions by the references made in other sections to the one he is examining, just as its own references to other sections will indicate what is in them, or what needs to be added. If a word were so unusual that it was nowhere mentioned, either in the discussion or in a reference, I dare assert it could be omitted without consequence. But are there likely to be many such, even among individual and particular things? It could only be if the thing in question held no notable place in the sciences, no useful species, no practical application in the arts. The horse chestnut tree, that tree that so abounds in useless fruits, is not even in this situation. There is nothing extant in nature or understanding, nothing that is practiced or employed in workshops, but what is linked by many threads to a general system of human knowledge. If on the contrary the item omitted were important, in order for the omission to be neither noticed, nor corrected, one would have to assume at a minimum one other omission, which would entail at least a third, and so forth, out to one solitary, isolated entity located at the outer limits of the system. There would be an entire order of entities or notions suppressed, which is metaphysically impossible. If there remains along the line just one such entity, or one such notion, one will be led from there, either by descending or by ascending, to the restitution of another, and so forth, until the entire empty interval is filled, the chain completed, and the encyclopedic order unbroken.</p>
	<p> By detailing in this way how a genuine encyclopedia ought to be made, we are establishing very severe rules, for examining and judging the one we are publishing. Whatever use is made of these rules whether for or against us, they prove at least that no one was better placed than the authors to criticize their own product. It remains to be seen whether our enemies, after furnishing heretofore strong enough evidence of their ignorance, will not determine to give evidence of cowardice by attacking us with weapons we have not feared to place in their hands.</p>
	<p> Repeated advance reading of the complete manuscript would doubtless obviate the need for three sorts of supplements: material, verbal, and for cross-referencing. How many terms, sometimes defined, sometimes merely mentioned in the course of an article, could take their place in the alphabetic order! How much knowledge announced in a place where it would not be sought in vain! How many principles that remain isolated, which could have been brought into conjunction by a catchword! The references in an article are like toothing stones awaiting their ornaments, which one sees sticking out at odd intervals on the vertical extremes of a long wall, or inside a convex vault, whose spacing anticipates elsewhere similar spacing and similar toothing stones.</p>
	<p> If I so insist on the necessity of possessing the entire text, it is because omissions are, in my opinion, the gravest defects in a dictionary. It is even better for an article to be badly done, than not done at all. Nothing so annoys a reader as not finding the word he is looking for. Here is a striking example, which I report all the more freely that I must share in the blame. A nice man buys a book on which I have worked: he was tormented by cramps, and was most eager to read the article cramp : he finds the word, but with a reference to convulsion ; he goes to convulsion , from whence he is referred to muscle , and from there to spasm , where he finds nothing on cramps.  That, I confess, is a most foolish mistake; and I doubt not but that we have committed it twenty times in the Encyclopedia . But we are entitled to insist upon some indulgence. The work on which we labor is not of our choosing: we did not arrange its primary materials which were furnished us, and they were so to speak thrown in our lap in a state of disorder which would have disheartened anyone either less honest, or less courageous. Our colleagues are witness to the pains we have taken and are still taking: no one knows like them what effort it has taken, and still takes, to bestow on the work all the perfection of a first attempt; and we planned, if not to obviate, at least to satisfy whatever objections we might elicit, by rereading our dictionary, once it was completed, with the intention of complementing the word list, the material, and the references.</p>
	<p> Nothing in the execution of a great work is minute; the slightest negligence has important consequences: the manuscript will serve as an example: being filled with personal names, terms of the arts, characters, numbers, letters, citations, references, etc., when published it will swarm with errors if it is not scrupulously exact. I would therefore like to invite the encyclopedists to write in capital letters words which it would be easy to mistake. In this way we would avoid almost all the typographical errors; the articles would be correct, the authors would have no reason to complain, and the reader would never be confused. Although we have not had the advantage of possessing a manuscript such as we would have wished, nevertheless there are few works printed with more care or elegance than ours. The attention and skill of the typographer have surpassed the disorder and imperfections of the copy; and we will offend none of our colleagues by asserting that among the many who have played some role in the Encyclopedia , none has better fulfilled his commitments than the printer. From this standpoint, which has struck and will strike people of taste and book collectors of any era, subsequent editions will be hard-pressed to equal the first.</p>
	<p> We think we are aware of all the advantages of an enterprise such as the one we pursue. We think we have had only too many opportunities to realize how difficult it was to emerge with some success from a first attempt, and how much the talents of a single man, whoever he be, were unequal to this project. On that score, long before we began we had some of the insight and all the diffidence that long reflection could inspire. Experience has not diminished these dispositions. We have seen, as we labored, the material expand, the word list become more recondite, contents reintroduced under a host of different names, instruments, machines, and operations multiply beyond measure, and the numerous turns of an extricable labyrinth become ever more complicated. We have seen what application it took to confirm that the same things were the same, and how difficult to confirm that others which seemed quite different, were not different. We have seen that this alphabetical form, which afforded us constant pauses, provided so much variety in the labor, and from these points of view appeared so advantageous to follow in a long work, had its difficulties for us to overcome at every moment. We have seen that it risked making crucial articles immensely long, if everything one could naturally hope to find in them was included; or make them dry and impoverished, if, thanks to references, we pruned them, and we eliminated from them many objects that could have lent themselves to separation. We have seen how important and difficult it was to keep to a happy medium. We have seen how many incorrect and false things escape notice; how many true ones we overlooked. We have seen that only the labor of several centuries could introduce into such a mass of collected materials, the true form that suited them; could give to each section its dimension; reduce each article to its appropriate length; suppress what was bad; supply the good that was missing, and finish an opus that could fulfill the design we had of it when we undertook it. But we have seen that of all the difficulties, one of the most considerable was to produce it just once, however amorphous it be, and that no one could ever take from us the honor of having overcome that obstacle. We have seen that the Encyclopedia could only be the effort of a philosophical century; that that century had come; that fame, by conferring immortality on the names of those who would bring it to fruition, would perhaps not refuse to take up ours; and we have felt inspired by the pleasant and consoling thought that people would talk about us when we were gone; by the sensual whisper that made us hear, in the mouths of a few of our contemporaries, what men to whose instruction and happiness we were sacrificing ourselves would say about us, men we esteemed and loved, even though they did not yet exist. We have felt grow in ourselves the seed of emulation, which at death envies the best part of ourselves, and snatches from oblivion the only moments of our existence that were genuinely charmed. Indeed, man reveals himself to his contemporaries and sees himself as he is, a strange composite of sublime qualities and shameful weaknesses. But the weaknesses follow the mortal remains into the tomb, and disappear with them; the same earth covers them both: all that remains are the qualities made everlasting by the monuments he has raised to himself, or which he owes to public veneration and gratitude: honors of which the conscience of his own merit gives him advance delight; delight as pure, as strong, as real as any other delight, and in which nothing can be imaginary except the titles on which one grounds one's pretensions. Ours are deposited in this work; posterity will judge them.</p>
	<p> I have said that only a philosophical century could attempt an encyclopedia ; and I said this because this work everywhere requires more boldness of mind than is normally possessed in centuries of cowardly taste. One must examine and stir up everything, without exception and without cautiousness: one must dare to see, as we are beginning to be persuaded, that literary genres resemble the general compilation of laws, and the first formation of cities, in that they owe their birth to a singular chance, a strange circumstance, sometimes a flight of genius; that those who came after the first inventors, were for the most part merely their slaves; that productions that should be regarded as the first step, taken blindly as the final achievement, instead of advancing an art to its perfection, have served only to hold it back, reducing other men to the servile condition of imitators; that as soon as a name was given to a composition of a particular character, one had to model strictly upon that sketch all those that were made; that if there appeared from time to time a man of daring and original genius, who, weary of the yoke received, dared to shake it off, depart from the ordinary path, and give birth to some work to which the given name and prescribed laws were not exactly applicable, he dropped into oblivion, and remained there a very long time. We must trample under foot all that old foolishness; overturn barriers not put there by reason; restore to the sciences and arts their precious liberty, and tell the admirers of Antiquity: call the London Merchant   anything you like, provided you concede that this play sparkles with sublime beauties. We needed a time of reasoning, when we no longer look for the rules in authors, but in nature, and when we can feel what is false and what true in all those arbitrary poetics; I am taking the term poetics in its most general sense, for a system of given rules, according to which, in whatever genre, people pretend you must work in order to succeed.</p>
	<p> But this century was so long in coming, that I have sometimes thought a people would be fortunate never to find an extraordinary man among them, under whom an art made its initial steps too great and too rapidly, who interrupted its invisible, natural movement. That man's works would necessarily be monstrous composites, because genius and good taste are very different qualities. Nature gives one of them in an instant; the other is the product of centuries. Such monsters will become national models; they will determine a people's taste. The good minds who follow, will find a bias in favor of them which they will not dare challenge; and the notion of the beautiful will dim, as the notion of the good would dim among uncivilized peoples who had adopted an excessive veneration for some chief of dubious character, who has made himself prominent by important services and favorable vices. In morality, God alone can serve as man’s model; in the arts, only nature. If the sciences and arts progress imperceptibly, one man will not differ sufficiently from another to influence him, found a genre that is adopted, and give its taste to a nation; consequently nature and reason will maintain their rights. They had lost them; they are about to recover them; and we shall see how important it was for us to recognize and seize this moment.</p>
	<p> As centuries pass by, the mass of works grows endlessly, and one can foresee a time when it will be almost as difficult to educate oneself in a library, as in the universe, and almost as fast to seek a truth subsisting in nature, as lost among an immense number of books; then one would have to undertake, out of necessity, a labor that had been neglected, because the need for it had not been felt.</p>
	<p> If we think of the image of literature in times before the invention of printing, we see a small number of men of genius busy creating, and a countless throng of workers busy transcribing. If we anticipate centuries to come, and think of the image of literature once printing, which never rests, has filled huge buildings with books, we will find it once more split into two classes of men. There will be those who read little and immerse themselves in new research or what they take to be new (for if we already are ignorant of part of what is contained in so many books published in all sorts of languages, we will know still far less about what is in those books increased a hundred-, a thousand-fold); the others, workmen incapable of producing anything, will be busy leafing through those books night and day, and separating out what they deem worthy of being anthologized and preserved. Is this prediction not already being fulfilled? And are not several of our men of letters not already busy reducing all our large books to small ones in which we still find much that is superfluous? Let us now suppose that their analyses are correct, and are distributed in alphabetical form into a number of volumes organized by intelligent men, and we will have the materials of an encyclopedia .</p>
	<p> We have therefore undertaken today for the good of letters, and out of interest for the human race, a work which our descendants would have had to undertake, but under much less favorable circumstances: when the overabundance of books would have made its execution extremely laborious.</p>
	<p> Allow me now, before examining further the encyclopedic material, to consider for a moment those authors who already occupy so many shelves in our libraries, are gaining terrain by the day, and in a century or two will by themselves occupy whole buildings. It must be a mortifying thought for these prolix writers, that from all the paper they have blackened with ink, there will not be a single line to extract for the universal dictionary of human knowledge. If they cannot survive by their excellence as colorists,  the particular quality which men of genius possess, I ask what will become of them.</p>
	<p> But it is natural that these remarks which we allow ourselves about the fate of so many others, should also bring us to examine ourselves, and contemplate the fate awaiting us. I examine our labor without partiality; I see that there is perhaps no kind of error we have not committed, and I am forced to admit that barely two-thirds of an encyclopedia such as ours would find a place in a genuine encyclopedia . That much is considerable, especially if one concedes that by casting the foundation of such a work, we were forced to take as our starting point a bad author, whoever that might have been, Chambers, Alstedius, or some other.  Almost none of our colleagues would have agreed to work, if we had proposed to them to create their own sections de novo ; they would all been frightened away, and the Encyclopedia would not have been written. But by giving to each a sheath of papers, which he had only to review, correct, and augment, the labor of creation, which is always what one dreads, disappeared, and one allowed himself to become engaged with barely a thought. For those disparate fragments turned out to be so incomplete, so badly written, so ill translated, so full of omissions, errors, and imprecision, so contrary to our colleagues' thoughts, that most rejected them. Would that all had been so bold! The only advantage the former obtained, was to learn at a glance the word list of their section, which they could have found at least as completely in the tables of different works, or of some dictionary of the language.</p>
	<p> That slight advantage cost dearly. How much time was lost translating bad things! What expenditure, from which to direct nothing more than continual plagiarism! How many mistakes and accusations we would have spared ourselves with a simple word list! But would it have sufficed to persuade our colleagues? Moreover, even that section could only be perfected through execution. As one executes a piece, the word list expands, the terms to be defined come up by the score; countless ideas occur to reference under various headings; what one does not do is at least indicated by a reference, as belonging to someone else's province: in a word, that which each one furnishes and asks of the others is the fount from which words spring.</p>
	<p> From this it can be seen (1) that in a first edition, we could not make use of too many colleagues, but that if our labor is not entirely useless, a small number of well-chosen men would be enough to execute a second. They should be put in charge of different subordinate workers, whom they would honor for the assistance de they provided, but whose work they would be obliged to accept, so that they would have no way to avoid finishing up, so that their own reputation would be in play, and they could be directly blamed for negligence or incompetence. A worker who dares to request that his name not be placed at the end of one of his articles, admits that he considers it less than well done, or at least not worthy of him. I believe that, according to this new arrangement, it would not be impossible for a single man to handle anatomy, medicine, surgery, the medical material, and a part of pharmacy; another chemistry, the remaining portion of pharmacy, and the chemical part of the arts, such as metallurgy, dyeing, part of the goldsmith's craft, part of the coppersmith's, plumbing, the preparation of all sorts of colors, metallic and otherwise, etc. A single man well-informed of some iron craft, could include the trades of the nail maker, the cutler, the locksmith, the edge-tool maker, etc. One versed in jewelry would be responsible for the jeweler’s art, the stone merchant, the stone mounter. I would always give the preference to a man who had successfully written about the subject he is in charge of. As for the man who was in the process of preparing an opus on the subject, I would accept him as a colleague only if he were already my friend, the honesty of his character was well known to me, and I could not without doing him the greatest insult suspect him of a secret design to sacrifice our opus to his own.</p>
	<p> (2) That the first edition of an encyclopedia can only be a very shapeless and incomplete compilation.</p>
	<p> But, you will say, how with all these defects did you manage to achieve a success that no production so considerable has ever had? To that I reply, that our Encyclopedia has over almost every other work, I do not say of the same length, but any at all, created by a society or by a single man, the advantage of containing innumerable new things, ones which anywhere else one would look for in vain. This is the natural result of the fortunate choice of those who have devoted themselves to it.</p>
	<p> There has never been, and will not be again for a long time, such a large and fine collection of machines. We have about a thousand plates. We are determined to spare nothing on engraving. Despite the prodigious number of figures that fill them, we have taken care to allow almost none that do not portray an existing and socially active machine. If you compare our volumes with the much applauded collection of Ramelli,  the machine theatre of Lupold , or even the volumes of machines approved by the Academy of Sciences , you can judge whether from all of those volumes combined, it was possible to take twenty plates worthy of being included in a collection like the one we have had the boldness to conceive and the good fortune to execute. Here there is nothing superfluous, nothing out of date or idealized: everything is in action and living. But independently of that merit, and whatever difference there may or ought necessarily to be between this first edition and subsequent ones, is it not something to have begun? Among countless difficulties which will come spontaneously to mind, just weigh simply that of having assembled a large number of colleagues, who, without knowing each other, all seem to collaborate in friendship in the production of a common opus. Men of letters have done for their peers and equals what one would not have obtained from them for any other consideration. Such is the motive to which we owe our first colleagues; and it is to the same cause that we owe those who are daily added to the enterprise. There prevails among all a sense of emulation, respect, agreement which is scarcely imaginable. Not content to furnish the assistance they have promised, they also make mutual sacrifices, which is much more difficult! Whence so many articles that coming from foreign hands, yet none of those responsible for the sciences to which they belong has ever taken offense. The reason is that individual interest is not involved; there obtains among us no petty personal jealousy, and the perfection of the work and usefulness to the human race have spawned the general feeling that motivates us.</p>
	<p> We have enjoyed a rare and precious advantage which must not be overlooked in the project for a second edition. Men of letters of the highest reputation, artists of first rank, have deigned to send us pieces of their work. We owe Eloquence, Elegance, Esprit, etc., to M. de Voltaire.  M. de Montesquieu left us at his death fragments for the article Taste ; M. de la Tour has promised us his thoughts on Painting ; M. Cochin the younger would not refuse to furnish us the article Engraving if his occupations left him time to write. </p>
	<p> It would not be without usefulness to establish correspondences in the principal sites of the learned world, and I have no doubt it could be accomplished. From it would come information on customs, productions, labors, machines, etc., if no one is overlooked, and if everyone is accorded that degree of consideration that is due the disinterested man who wants to make himself useful.</p>
	<p> It would be an inexcusable oversight not to obtain the great German encyclopedia ,  the collected regulations of the arts and crafts of London and other countries; the works the English call mysteries , the famous regulations for Piedmont manufactures, customs registers, several inventories of the households of great noblemen and bourgeois; all the treatises on the arts in general and particular, the regulations of commerce, the statutes of communities, all the collections of the academies, especially the academic collection of which the preliminary discourse and the first volumes have just been published. Such a work cannot fail to be excellent, to judge by the sources on which they propose to draw, and by the breadth of knowledge, the fecundity of thought, the firmness of judgment and taste of the man who directs this great enterprise.  The greatest fortune that can befall those who will succeed us in the Encyclopedia , and who will assume the work of the following editions, is that the dictionary of the French Academy, such as I conceive it, and as it is conceived by the best minds in that illustrious company, should have appeared, that the natural history should have been published in its entirety,  and that the academic collection be completed. What labor would be spared!</p>
	<p> Among the other books which it is essential to acquire, one should count the catalogues of the great libraries: it is there one comes to know the sources on which one must draw; it would even be desirable for the editor to be in correspondence with the librarians. While it is necessary to consult good works, it is not useless to leaf through bad ones. A good book furnishes one or several excellent articles; a bad book helps you do better. It adds to your task; the former condenses it. Besides, without a considerable knowledge of the bibliography, you run the constant risk of writing poorly, with great effort and much time and expense, what others have executed superbly. You go to great effort to discover things that are well known. I might observe that except for the material on the arts, everything that is properly with a dictionary's ken has already been published, and consequently it is all the more desirable that each person be familiar with the great books composed in his section, and that the editor be armed with the most complete and extensive catalogues.</p>
	<p> The exact citation of sources would be extremely useful: this rule should be imposed. It would be an important service to those preparing to study a particular science or art, to give them an acquaintance of the best authors, the best editions, and the order they should follow in their reading. The Encyclopedia has sometimes done this correctly; it ought never to have failed.</p>
	<p> One must analyze scrupulously and faithfully every work to which time has assured a constant reputation. I say time , because there is a great difference between an encyclopedia and a collection of journals. An encyclopedia is a rapid and disinterested exposition of the discoveries of men in all places, all kinds, and all centuries, without any judgment of persons; whereas journals are but a momentary history of works and authors. They indiscriminately review felicitous and infelicitous efforts, which is to say that in a newspaper that deserves some attention, countless books are lengthily discussed which are forgotten before the last issue of the year has come out. How much these periodicals would be abbreviated, if only an interval of time were allowed between the publication of a book and the review that would or would not appear: a given work that was discussed at length in the journal, would not even be mentioned. But what purpose does the extract serve when the book is forgotten? A universal and analytical dictionary is destined for the general and permanent instruction of the human race; periodicals, for the momentary satisfaction of the curiosity an idle few. They are little read by men of letters.</p>
	<p> One must particularly extract from authors their systems, exceptional thoughts, observations, experiments, views, maxims, and facts.</p>
	<p> But there are works so important, so well thought out, so precise, few in number to be sure, that an encyclopedia must swallow them whole. I speak of those in which the general object is treated in a methodical manner and in depth, such as the Essay Concerning Human Understanding , although too diffuse; the Considérations sur les moeurs , although too dense; the Institutions astronomiques , although they are not elementary enough, and so forth. </p>
	<p> The observations, facts, experiments, etc., must be distributed to their appropriate locations.</p>
	<p> One must know how to dismember a work skillfully, manage its distributions, present its outline, give an analysis of it in the body of an article, the references of which will indicate the rest of the object. The idea is not to break its joints, but to distend them; not to separate the parts, but to disassemble them and scrupulously preserve what artists call reference marks. </p>
	<p> Sometimes it is important to mention absurd things; but it must be done lightly and in passing, solely for the history of the human mind, which reveals itself better in certain unusual oddities than in the most reasonable act. These oddities are to the moralist what the dissection of a monster is to the natural historian: it is more useful to him than to study a hundred individuals that are alike. There are words that depict more forcefully and completely than a whole discourse. A man to whom no ill act could be reproached was saying terrible things about human nature. Someone asked him, but where have you observed man as being so hideous? In myself , he replied. This was an evil man who had never done any wrong; may he die soon! Another was saying of an old friend: so-and-so is a very honest man; he is poor, but that does not keep me from making him an unusual case. I have been his friend for forty years, and he has never asked me for a penny. Ah, Moliére, where were you? You wouldn't have missed that example, and your Miser   would offer none either truer or more emphatic.</p>
	<p> Since it is also at least as important to make men better, as to make them less ignorant, I would not be displeased for us to collect every striking example of moral virtues. They must be well attested: each would be distributed to the article it would enliven. Why should we be so attentive to the preservation of the history of men's thoughts, and neglect the history of their acts? Is it not the most useful; is it not the history that does the most honor to the human race? I do not wish to have bad deeds recalled; it were better they had never existed. Man has no need of bad examples, nor does human nature need to be more decried. One should mention dishonest acts only when they have been followed, not by loss of life and property, which are only too often the sad consequences of the practice of virtue, but when they have made the evil man unhappy and despised amidst of the most brilliant rewards for his crimes. The examples that ought to be collected above all, would be those where the character of honesty is joined with that of great insight, or heroic steadfastness. The example of M. Pellisson would surely not be forgotten. He files an accusation against his master and benefactor, who is taken to the Bastille; he is brought to face the man he accused, to whom he attributes some imaginary fraud. The accused asks for the evidence. The evidence? replies Pelisson. Well, sir, it can only be found in your papers, and you know quite well they have all been burned: and so they had been. Pelisson had burned them himself, but he needed to inform the prisoner of this; and he did not hesitate to have recourse to an expedient, a sure one in truth, since everyone was fooled by it; but one which risked his freedom, perhaps his life, and which, had it not been found out, which was possible, would have attached everlasting ignominy to his name, and could redound to the shame of the republic of letters, in which Pelisson held a distinguished position.  M. Gobinot of Reims has borne for forty years the public indignation he incurred by excessive niggardliness from which he gained enormous sums which he used for monuments of the greatest utility. To him let us add a prelate respectable for his apostolic qualities, his distinctions, his birth, the noble simplicity of his daily life, and the solidity of his virtues. During a great calamity, it occurred to this prelate, after he had provided relief with generous free distributions of money and grain to that portion of his flock that allowed all its indigence to be seen, to assist the part that hid its misery, those whose cries were stifled by embarrassment and were only the more unhappy, against the oppression of those bloody men whose soul is overjoyed amidst of the general murmur, and he has grain brought to the public square where it is distributed for a price well below what it has cost. The partisan bias that abhors any virtuous act which is not by one of its own members, calls his charity a monopoly, and an little-known knave inscribes this horrible calumny among those with which he has long filled his weekly papers.  Meanwhile new calamities arrive: the inalterable devotion of this rare pastor continues to act, and finally a decent man comes along who raises his voice, and speaks the truth, giving recognition to virtue, and exclaiming, ecstatic with admiration: What courage! what heroic patience! How consoling to the human race that spitefulness is incapable of such efforts. Such are the examples that should be collected; and who would read them without feeling warmth in his heart? If an anthology were published containing many such great and praiseworthy deeds, who would consent to die without furnishing the material for a line? Can one imagine a more stirring opus? It seems to me there would be few pages which a man born with an honest and sensitive soul would not wet with his tears.</p>
	<p> One must be particularly careful to avoid adulation. When praise is deserved, it would be most unfair to grant it only to the unfeeling, cold ashes of those who can no longer hear it: shall the equity that dispenses it yield to the modesty that refuses it? Praise is an incitement to virtue; it is a public pact you force the virtuous man to contract. If his praiseworthy deeds were engraved on a column, would he for a moment lose sight of that imposing monument? Would it not be one of the staunchest supports one could lend to human weakness? The man would have to determine to break his own statue. Praise of an honest man is the most worthy and endearing recompense from another honest man: after the praise of his conscience, the most flattering praise is that of the man of good will. O Rousseau, my dear and worthy friend, I have never had the strength to refrain from praising thee: I have felt my attraction to truth grow, and my love of virtue. Why so many funeral orations, and so few panegyrics of the living? Do you think Trajan would not have feared to give the lie to his panegyrist? If you do, you don't know the full power of everybody's admiration. After the praiseworthy deeds one has done, the keenest incentive to multiply their number is the notoriety of the first ones; and it is this notoriety that gives man a public character which he cannot easily give up. Is this innocent secret not even one of the most important of a virtuous education? Put your son in a position to practice virtue; give him a household reputation for his good deeds; attach to his name some epithet which reminds him of them; grant him some admiration: it he ever breaks that barrier, I dare assert that his soul is fundamentally bad; that your child is lowborn, and you will never make anything but a wicked man of him; with this difference, that he would have plunged head first into vice, and that held back by the contrast he has observed between the honorable names he has been given, and those he is going to incur, he will let himself slide towards evil, but on a slope that will not be so slight that attentive parents will fail to notice the successive degradation of his character.</p>
	<p> I detest satires in a book a hundred times more than I favor praise: personal sarcasms are odious in any kind of writing; one is sure to amuse ordinary men, when one makes a point of feeding their meanness. The tone of satire is the worst of all for a dictionary; and the most impertinent and tedious of conceivable books would be a satirical dictionary: it is the only kind we lack. The offhand remark, the subtle allusion, the dainty flourish, must be absolutely banned in a great book; barbs that have to be explained go stale, or soon become unintelligible. It would be perfectly ridiculous to need a commentary in a work, of which the various sections are intended mutually to interpret each other. All that flippancy is just a foam that gradually dies down; soon the volatile part has evaporated, and all that remains is insipid sludge. Such also is the fate of most sparks that fly in the give-and-take of conversation: the agreeable, but passing, sensation they excite comes from their attachment to the moment, the circumstances, the places, the persons, the day's events: attachments which rapidly disappear. Barbs that are not noticeable, because attracting attention is not their principal merit, full of substance, and bearing the character of simplicity combined with great good sense, are the only ones that would hold up in the light of day; to sense the frivolity of the others, one only has to write them. If you showed me an author who had composed his miscellany based on conversations, I would be almost certain he has collected everything he should have ignored, and ignored everything he needed to collect. Let us take care not to commit with those whom we consult, the same mistake that writer would make with the persons he frequents. Great works are like great edifices: their only ornaments are large and few in number. Such ornaments must be distributed with restraint and discretion, or they will detract from simplicity by multiplying relations; from grandeur, by separating the sections and obscuring the whole; from interest, by dividing attention, which in the absence of this defect, which distracts and disperses it, would all be concentrated on the principal masses.</p>
	<p> Although I proscribe satires, the same does not hold for portraits, nor reflections. Virtues are linked to each other, and vices are held, so to speak, by the hand. There is no virtue and no vice that has not its retinue: it is a sort of necessary association. To imagine a character is to identify in function of a given dominant passion, good or bad, the subordinate passions which accompany it, the sentiments, the words and deeds it suggests, and the sort of coloration or energy that the whole intellectual and moral system receives from it: whence we see that ideal paintings, conceived in terms of relations and mutual influence of virtues and vices, can never become chimerical; they are what lends plausibility to dramatic performances and all moral writings; and individuals will forever be found in society who have the good or ill fortune to look like them. And so it is that a century far removed raises hideous or respectable statues, at the base of which posterity writes various names in turn: they write Montesquieu where Plato had been engraved; Desfontaines,  where formerly one read Erostratus  or Zoilus : with the disturbing difference that there will never be a shortage of increasingly dishonored names to replace those of Erostratus or Zoilus; whereas we dare not hope that the succession of centuries will offer us names increasingly more illustrious to replace Montesquieu, and come third or fourth after Plato. We cannot raise too many such statues in our opus: they should be in bronze on our public squares and in our gardens, and invite us to virtue on the pedestals where the debauchery of pagan gods has been portrayed before our eyes and our children's.</p>
	<p> After treating the encyclopedic material in general, the reader might wish that we should enter into the examination of each of its sections in particular; but it is for the public, and not for us, to judge our labor and that of our colleagues.</p>
	<p> We will simply answer to those who would have preferred we omit theology, that it is a field of knowledge; that this knowledge is very extensive and interesting, and that it could have been made more engaging than mythology, which they would have been sorry to see omitted.</p>
	<p> To those who exclude geography from our dictionary: that the names and the longitude and latitude of the stars which they would admit, have no more right to remain there than the names, the longitude and latitude of the cities they reject.</p>
	<p> To those who would have wished it be less dry: that it was necessary to limit ourselves to the only knowledge of cities that was scientific, the only kind that would enable us to construct good maps of ancient times, if we possessed it, and which will enable our posterity to construct good maps of our times, if we pass it on; and that the rest, being entirely historical, lies outside our object.</p>
	<p> To those who have found certain traits of history, cuisine, fashion, etc. repugnant: that they have forgotten how many works of erudition these topics have spawned; that the most succinct of our articles of this sort will perhaps spare our descendants years of research and volumes of dissertations; that supposing future scientists are immeasurably more reserved than those of the last century, it is still to be presumed that they will not disdain to write a few pages to explain what is a furbelow or a pompon  ; that a study of our fashions, which today would be considered a frivolous piece of work, would be viewed a thousand years hence as a learned and insightful work on French dress, a work most instructive for writers, painters and sculptors; insofar as our cuisine is concerned, it cannot be disputed that it is an important branch of chemistry.</p>
	<p> To those who have complained that our botany was neither complete nor sufficiently engaging: that these objections are utterly without foundation; that it was impossible to go further than genuses without compiling folios; that we have omitted none of the common plants; we have described them; we have given their chemical analysis, properties, either remedial or nutritive; the only thing we could have added, which would have been scientific and would not have taken up a great deal of space, would have been to indicate under the genus article how many species were known, and how many varieties; and as for the tree portion which is so considerable, it has in the Encyclopedia , from the third volume on, all the development that could be desired.</p>
	<p> To those who are unhappy with the arts portion, and to those who are satisfied with it: that they are all right, because there are items in this immense sector that are very badly done indeed, and others which could hardly be done better.</p>
	<p> But as the arts have been the principal object of my work, I am going to express myself freely, both on the mistakes into which I have fallen, and on the precautions which would have to be taken to correct them.</p>
	<p> He who shall undertake the domain of the arts, will not satisfactorily fulfill his mission, for others and for himself, unless he has made extensively study of natural history, and especially of mineralogy; unless he is an excellent mechanician; unless he is well versed in rational and experimental physics, and unless he has read several courses in chemistry.</p>
	<p> As a naturalist, he will know at a glance the substances the artists are using, and which they ordinarily make such a secret.</p>
	<p> As a chemist, he will be familiar with the properties of those substances: he will see the reasons for countless procedures; he will reveal the secrets; the artists will not deceive him; he will immediately detect the absurdity of their lies; he will grasp the meaning of an operation: sleight of hand will not escape his notice; he will easily distinguish between an indifferent movement and an essential precaution; everything he writes about the arts will be clear, sure, and revealing; and conjectures on the means of perfecting the arts we have, of rediscovering lost ones, and of inventing new ones, will come readily to his mind.</p>
	<p> Physics will let him understand countless phenomena that leave the workers amazed their whole lives.</p>
	<p> With mechanics and geometry, he will easily achieve the true and real calculation of forces; he will then need only to gain experience, to temper the rigor of mathematical suppositions, a quality which distinguishes, especially in the construction of delicate machines, the great artist from the common worker to whom one can never communicate a clear notion of that temperament, if he has not acquired it, and in whom it can never be corrected, if he has formed false notions of it.</p>
	<p> Armed with these fields of knowledge, he will first introduce some order into his work, by relating the arts to natural substances, which is always possible; for the history of arts is nothing but applied natural history . See Map of the System of Human Knowledge.</p>
	<p> He will then trace for each artist an outline to fill in; he will oblige them to deal with the material they employ, the places where it is found, the price they pay for it, etc., the instruments, the various processes, and all the operations.</p>
	<p> He will compare the artists' drafts with his outline; he will confer with them, have them add aloud what they have failed to include, and clarify what they have not adequately explained.</p>
	<p> However poor those drafts, if they have been done in good faith, they will always contain countless things that the most intelligent man will never notice or suspect and cannot ask. To be sure, he will desire others; but they will be things the artist hides from no one: for I have found that those who deal constantly with an object have an equal tendency to believe that what they make no secret of, everyone knows; and that no one knows what they are keeping secret: so that they were always tempted to regard the person questioning them as either a transcendent genius or an imbecile.</p>
	<p> While artists continue to work, he will try to correct the articles we have communicated to him, and which he will find in our dictionary. It will not take him long to discover that despite all our efforts, glaring errors have slipped in (see the article Brick), and that there are entire articles which contain not an ounce of good sense (see the article Cloth Bleaching): but he will learn by experience to thank us for the things that are well done, and forgive those that are bad. Once especially he has spent some time frequenting workshops, money in hand, and had to pay dearly for the silliest falsehoods, he will know what kind of people artists are, especially in Paris, where the fear of taxes makes them perpetually diffident, and where they consider any man who asks them questions with some degree of curiosity an emissary of the farmers general,  or as a worker who wants to go into business for himself. I have thought that these pitfalls would be avoided by seeking in the provinces all the knowledge on the arts that could be collected there: there you are known, you talk to people who are not suspicious; money is rarer, and time less dear. Whence it seems evident to me that there things could be learned more easily and less expensively, and that the information would be more reliable.</p>
	<p> One must indicate the origins of an art, and follow its stages step by step when they can be known, or substitute conjecture and hypothetical history for the real one. It can be affirmed that in this the novel  would often be more instructive than reality.</p>
	<p> But the origin and progress of an art are not like the origin and progress of a science. Scientists converse; they write; they put forward their discoveries; they refute; they are refuted. Such contestations manifest the facts and fix the dates. Artists on the contrary live unknown, hidden, isolated; they do everything for their interests, and almost nothing for their glory. There are inventions that are kept within a family for centuries: they pass from fathers to sons, are improved or atrophy, without anyone knowing either by whom or when the discovery can be said to have been made. The incremental steps by which an art progresses toward perfection also confound dating. One man harvests the hemp; another soaks it; a third scutches it: first it is a crude cord, then a thread, and ultimately canvas: but a century goes by between each of these stages. The man who would develop a product from its natural state all the way to its highest use, could hardly escape notice. How could it be impossible for a society to find itself all of a sudden wearing a new fabric, without asking who was to be thanked? But such cases do not occur, or occur only rarely.</p>
	<p> Chance commonly suggests the first attempts; they bear no fruit and remain buried; another tries again: he has a partial success, but not the kind people talk about; a third walks in the second's footsteps; a fourth in the third's; and so on, until the end product of these experiments is excellent: and this product is the only one that creates a sensation. It also occurs that an idea has barely blossomed in a workshop before it gets out and about. Work goes on in several places at once: each man operates separately; and the same invention, claimed at the same time by several, properly belongs to none of them, or is only attributed to the one it makes rich. If the invention has come from abroad, national jealousy mutes the inventor’s name, and it remains unknown.</p>
	<p> The government ought to allow entry to its manufactures to watch the men work, ask them questions, make drawings of their instruments, machines, and even the premises. </p>
	<p> There are circumstances in which artists are so closed-lipped that the quickest means would be to become an apprentice oneself, or have an associate do so.</p>
	<p> There are few secrets one could not manage to learn by such means: these secrets without exception ought to be divulged.</p>
	<p> I know that this opinion is not shared by all: there are narrow minds, unkind souls, indifferent to the fate of the human race, and so focused on their little society that they see nothing beyond its interests. These men want to be called good citizens; and that is all right with me, provided they allow me to call them cruel men . One would think, to hear them, that a well-made encyclopedia , a general history of the arts, should be nothing but a big manuscript carefully locked up in the monarch's library, and unavailable to any eyes other than his: a book of state, and not of the people. What good is it to divulge a nation's knowledge, its hidden transactions, its inventions, industry, resources, secrets, arts and all its wisdom! Are these not things it owes in part to its superiority over rival, neighboring nations? That is what they say; and here is what they could further add. Would it not be preferable, rather than enlightening the foreigner, to shed ignorance on him, and plunge the rest of the world into savagery, the better to rule over it? They fail to notice that they occupy no more than a point on this globe, and will last but an instant; and to this point and this moment they wish to sacrifice the happiness of future centuries and the entire species. They know better than anybody that the average life of an empire is less than two thousand years, and that in less time than that, perhaps, the name French , that name that will last forever in history, will be impossible to find on the surface of the earth. These considerations do not expand their vision; it seems that to them the word humanity is devoid of meaning. Were they at least consistent! But at other times they will rave at the mystery shrouding Egyptian temples: they will deplore the loss of ancient knowledge; blame the negligence or silence of the writers who were mum or spoke so inadequately of countless important objects; and they will never realize that they are demanding of earlier men what they call a crime today, and fault the others for having been what they take pride in being.</p>
	<p> These good citizens are the most dangerous enemies we have had. In general, one should benefit from criticism, without answering it, when it is good; ignore it, when it is bad. Is it not pleasant, for all those who doggedly blacken paper against us, to think that if the Encyclopedia maintains for ten years the reputation it now enjoys, no one will talk about their writings any more, and even less so if it is itself ignored.</p>
	<p> I once heard someone say to M. de Fontenelle that his apartment could not hold all the things that had been published against him.  Who knows a single one of them? L'esprit des lois and Histoire naturelle have only recently appeared, and the criticisms written of them are entirely forgotten.  We have already observed that among those who rose to censure the Encyclopedia , scarcely a one had the necessary talent to enrich it with a good article. I do not think it would be exaggerating to add that it is a book which they would do well to study a good bit. It was written in a philosophical spirit, and most of those who judge us are in that regard far from even the level of their century. I appeal to their writings. It is for this reason that they will not last, and that we dare presume that our dictionary will be even more read and admired in several years than it is today. We would have no difficulty naming other authors who have had or will have the same fate. Some (as we already said above), raised to the heavens, because they had written for the throng, because they had submitted to current thinking, and placed themselves within reach of average readers, have lost their reputation, as the human spirit progressed, and have finally been forgotten. Others on the contrary, too advanced for the times in which they appeared, were little read, little understood, not appreciated at all, and long remained virtually unknown, until the time when the century they were leading was past, and another century to which they belonged before it came, reached them, and finally did justice to their merit.</p>
	<p> I think I have taught my fellow citizens to read chancellor Bacon ; this wise author has been more pored over in the last five or six years than ever before. We are nevertheless far from appreciating the importance of his works; minds are not yet sufficiently advanced. There are too few people in a position to rise to the level of his meditations; and the number will perhaps never increase by much. Who knows whether the Novum organum , the Cogitata et visa , the book De augmento scientiarum , are not too far above the average reach of the human mind, to become in any century easy and common reading? Only time can resolve this doubt.</p>
	<p> But these considerations on the spirit and matter of an encyclopedic dictionary bring us naturally to discuss the style appropriate to this sort of opus.</p>
	<p> Laconicism is not the tone for a dictionary; it would leave too much to guesswork for most readers. I prefer that what is left to the reader be limited to what could be lost without leaving him ill informed on the basics. The effect of diversity, besides the fact of its inevitability, does not in this case appear to me displeasing. Every laborer, every science, every art, every article, every subject has its language and its style. What is the harm of preserving them? If the editor had to make his hand visible everywhere, the work would be considerably slowed down, without being better. However well informed an editor be, he would often risk committing a material error, while thinking he was correcting a mistake in language.</p>
	<p> I would summarize the general character of an encyclopedia 's style in two words: communia, proprie, proprié, communiter .  By heeding this rule, common things will always be elegant; and proper and particular things always clear.</p>
	<p> A universal dictionary of the sciences and arts needs to be thought of as a vast countryside containing mountains, plains, rocks, water, forests, animals, and all the objects that make for the variety of a great landscape. The light of heaven falls on them all; but it strikes them all in different ways. Some stand out by nature and exposure, in the front of the scene; others are spread out on countless intermediate planes; some fade into the distance; all enhance each other.</p>
	<p> If the slightest trace of affectation is unbearable in a small opus, how would a major opus look in the judgment of men of letters, in which such a flaw were egregious? I am sure that the excellence of the subject matter would not compensate for the defect of style, and it would be little read. The works of two of the greatest men nature has produced, one a philosopher, and the other a poet, would be infinitely more perfect and admired, if those rare men had not been gifted to a quite extraordinary degree with two talents that to me seem contradictory, genius and wit.  The most sublime thoughts are constantly spoiled by brilliant jabs and the most ingenious comparisons. Nature would have dealt much more kindly with them if, having endowed them with genius, she had denied them wit. Solid and genuine taste, the sublime in whatever genre, pathos, the great effects of fear, commiseration and terror, noble and lofty sentiments, and great thoughts all reject epigrammatic turns and contrasted expression.</p>
	<p> If however there is a work that allows for variety of style, it is an encyclopedia ; but as I intended for the most indifferent objects to be always tacitly related to man, to take on a moral dimension, to bespeak decency, dignity, sensitivity, elevation of the soul, in a word that the breath of uprightness should be everywhere discernable, I would have the tone answer to those purposes, and take from them some austerity, even in places where the most brilliant and cheerful colors would not have been out of place. To entertain and please, when one can instruct and move, is to miss the mark.</p>
	<p> As for purity of diction, that is something the reader is entitled to expect in any work. I do not know where people got their demeaning indulgence for large opuses and especially for dictionaries. It is as if folios were entitled to be written heavily, negligently, and without genius, taste, or subtlety. Do they believe it is impossible to introduce these qualities into a lengthy and exacting work? Or is it that since most such works which have appeared up till now commonly have these defects, they are regarded as inherent to the format?</p>
	<p> Yet one will notice, if one looks more closely, that if there is an opus into which it is a simple matter to inject some style, it is a dictionary; everything is cut up into articles; and its longest pieces are less long than an oratorical performance.</p>
	<p> But here is the thing. It is rare that those who write excellently wish and are able to continue for long such an arduous task; besides, in collective works where the glory of success is shared, and where the labor of one man is conflated with the labor of many, you identify someone else as your competitor; you compare your work to his; you would blush to do less well than he; you worry little about doing better; you use only part of your strength; and you hope that any neglect of yours will disappear in the immensity of the volumes.</p>
	<p> For this reason, each man's self-interest diminishes as the number of collaborators rises; and as the work of an individual stands out less the more colleagues there are, the book overall will tend more toward mediocrity as more hands are employed in its making.</p>
	<p> Time however lifts the veil; each is judged according to his merit. The negligent laborer is distinguished from the hard-working one who has done his duty. What a few have done shows what all should be expected to do; and the public names the ones with whom it is dissatisfied, and regrets that they should have answered so poorly to the importance of the enterprise, and the choice which had honored them.</p>
	<p> I express myself on this subject with all the more liberty that no one will risk this kind of censure more than I, and because, whatever criticism is made of our labors, either in general or in particular, it will be none the less true that it would be very difficult to create a second society of men of letters and artists as numerous and better constituted than the one which collaborates on the production of this dictionary. If it would have been easy to find someone better than me as author and editor, one must agree that it was, for these two functions, infinitely easier to find someone less able than M. D'Alembert. How I would gain from the kind of listing where some men would compensate for others! Add to this that there are sections for which one does not choose, and this problem will obtain for all editions. Whatever royalty a man were offered, he would never put in the time requested of him. An artist must work late in his shop; a public man must attend to his duties. The latter is unfortunately too busy, and the studious man is unfortunately not well enough informed. In this case you do what you can.</p>
	<p> But if it is a simple matter for a dictionary to be well written, there is hardly any work in which that is more important. The longer a journey must be, the more desirable that it be pleasant. Besides, we have some reason to believe that from this standpoint we have not been altogether unsuccessful. There are people who have read the Encyclopedia from one end to the other; and if we except Bayle's dictionary  which loses some of this prerogative with each day, there is hardly any other than ours which has enjoyed and still enjoys it. We hope it will not retain it long, since we prefer the progress of the human spirit to the durability of our productions, and we would have succeeded beyond our hopes, if we had rendered knowledge so popular, that the average man required a work more challenging than the Encyclopedia , to captivate and inform him.</p>
	<p> As far as style goes, it would be desirable to be able to imitate Petronius, who provided at once the example and the precept, when, having to depict the qualities of a fine discourse, he said: Grandis, et ut ita dicam pudica oratio neque maculosa est neque turgida, sed naturali pulchritudine exsurgit .  Description is the thing itself.</p>
	<p> We must especially avoid obscurity, and remember at every line that a dictionary is made for everybody, and that the repetition of words that would be annoying in a book for entertainment becomes a character of simplicity that will never displease in a large one.</p>
	<p> Let there never be anything vague in the expression. In a philosophical work it would be wrong to use the most ordinary words when they convey no fixed, distinct, and determined notion; and such terms exist in very great number. If we could give them definitions, according to nature which does not change, and not according to the conventions and prejudices of men which change constantly, these definitions would become the germs of discovery. Let us also point out here our continual demand for an invariable and constant model to which our definitions and descriptions can be linked, such as the nature of man, animals, or other extant beings. The rest is nothing, and he who does not know how to dispense with certain specific, local, and transitory notions, is impeded in his work and constantly risks, in opposition to what his conscience tells him and his mind's inclination, saying things that are incorrect for the moment, and false or at least obscure and conjectural for the future.</p>
	<p> The works of the most intrepid and lofty geniuses, of the greatest philosophers of Antiquity, are somewhat disfigured by this flaw. Those of our time are far from exempt. Intolerance, the lack of the double doctrine,  the defect of a hieroglyphic and sacred language, will forever perpetuate these contradictions, and continue to blemish our finest productions. Often we do not know what a man has thought about the most important matters. He wraps himself in affected abstruseness; even his contemporaries do not know his sentiments; and it must not be expected that an encyclopedia will be free from this defect.</p>
	<p> The more abstract the topic, the more we must strive to make it accessible to all readers.</p>
	<p> An editor with some experience, who can discipline himself, will place himself in the middle class of minds. If nature had raised him to the first level of genius, and he had never descended lower, ever conversing with men of the greatest insight, he would be able to contemplate objects from a viewpoint to which the throng cannot aspire. Too far above them, the work would become enigmatic for everyone. But if he were unfortunately, or had were condescending enough to act, beneath them, the material presented as if for imbeciles would become lengthy and tedious. He will therefore consider the world his school, and the human race his pupil; and he will dictate lessons that will neither cause good minds to waste precious time, nor discourage the mass of ordinary minds. There are two classes of men, about equally narrow, who should be equally ignored. These are the transcendent geniuses and the imbeciles, neither of which needs teachers.</p>
	<p> But though it is not easy to grasp the common capacity of minds, it is much less so still for the man of genius to stop there. Genius naturally tends to rise; it seeks the ethereal regions; with a moment's inattention it is swiftly swept away, and soon ordinary eyes can no longer spot and follow it.</p>
	<p> If each encyclopedist had performed his work well, an editor's principal concern would be reduced to circumscribing the various objects rigorously, enclosing the sections within themselves, and deleting repetitions, which is always easier to do than to fill in omissions; repetitions can be seen and corrected with a stroke of the pen, whereas omissions hide and cannot be filled in without labor. The great dilemma is that when they stand out, it is so suddenly that with the editor finding himself pressed between the subject matter which requires time, and the rapid pace of printing which allows none, either the work must be mangled, or the order perverted: the work mangled if the task is fulfilled in terms of time; the order perverted, if it is referred away to some far-removed location in the dictionary.</p>
	<p> Where is the man sufficiently versed in all the subjects to write about them as needed, as if he had long studied them? Where is the editor who has an author's principles present enough in his mind, or notions sufficiently in conformity with his, to avoid falling into some contradiction?</p>
	<p> Is it not even a labor almost beyond his strength, having to spot the contradictions that will necessarily arise between his associates' principles and thoughts? If resolving them when they are real is not his function, he at least must do so when they are only apparent: and in the first case, can he avoid pointing them out, highlighting them, noting their source, showing the common path that two authors have followed, and the point of separation where they began to part company; weighing their reasons; proposing observations and experiments for and against; pointing toward the side of truth, or of plausibility? He can put the work beyond reproach only by observing expressly that it is not the dictionary which contradicts itself, but the sciences and the arts which are not in agreement. Were he to go further, to resolve the difficulties, he would be a man of genius; but can one require of an editor that he be a man of genius? And would it not be folly to ask him to be a universal genius?</p>
	<p> One care I will recommend to the editor who succeeds us, both for the good of the opus, and for his personal security, is to send to the censors the printed sheets, and not the manuscript. With this precaution, the articles will be neither lost, nor re-arranged, nor suppressed; and the censor's initials at the bottom of the printed sheet will be the surest guarantee that nothing has been added, or altered, or removed, and that the work has remained in the state in which he has judged it is suitable for printing.</p>
	<p> But the name and function of censor remind me of an important question. We have been asked whether it would not be better for the Encyclopedia to have a tacit rather than a formal permission : those who maintained the affirmative said that then the authors would enjoy all the freedom necessary to create a superior opus. How many important subjects would be treated! What fine articles would be provided by public access! How many others could be printed in two columns, one establishing the pro, the other the contra! What is historical would be presented impartially; what is good openly praised; what is evil unreservedly condemned; truths affirmed; doubts put forward; prejudices destroyed, and the use of political references very restrained.</p>
	<p> Their opponents simply replied that it was better to sacrifice a little freedom than risk falling into excess; and moreover, they added, such is the constitution of things about us, that if an extraordinary man had conceived the writing of a work as extensive as ours, and were gifted by the Supreme Being to know the truth in all things, his security would still require that he be assigned to some inaccessible location in the sky, from whence his pages would drop to earth.</p>
	<p> Since it is then so advantageous to undergo literary censorship, one cannot have too intelligent a censor: he must know how to enter into the work's general character; to see without self-interest or faint-heartedness; to respect only what is genuinely respectable; to recognize the tone that befits every person and every subject; to recoil neither in the face of Diogenes' cynical remarks, nor Winslou’s  technical terms, nor the syllogisms of Anaxagoras ; not to require the refutation, weakening, or suppression of what is simply recounted historically; to sense the difference between an immense work and a duodecimo; and to possess enough love for the truth, virtue, and the progress of human knowledge and the nation’s honor, to have only these great objects in view.</p>
	<p> Such is the censor I would wish; as to the man I would desire as author, he would be firm, well informed, honest, truthful; without country, without sect, without station; relating things of the moment when he lives as if he were a thousand years removed, and those of the place where he lives as if he were a thousand leagues removed. But whom should such a worthy colleague have as editor? A man endowed with great good sense, well known for the breadth of his knowledge, the loftiness of his sentiments and thoughts, and his love of labor: a man loved and respected for his domestic and public character; never fanatical, unless it be for truth, virtue, and humanity.</p>
	<p> One must not imagine that the confluence of so many favorable circumstances would leave the Encyclopedia free of imperfection: there will always be defects in a work of this magnitude. They will be corrected in the first instance, as they are discovered, through supplements; but the time will necessarily come when the public itself will desire it to be completely redone; and as one cannot know to whose hands this important labor will be entrusted, it remains uncertain whether the new edition will be inferior or preferable to the previous one. It is not rare to see major works clumsily revised, amended, and expanded, degenerate at each printing, and finally be scorned. We could cite a recent example,  if we did not fear we were giving in to resentment while thinking we were bowing to the interests of truth.</p>
	<p> The Encyclopedia can easily be improved; it can also easily deteriorate. But the danger that must principally be countered, and which we have foreseen, is that the care of subsequent editions not be turned over to the despotism of a society or a company of any kind.  We have announced, and we attest to our contemporaries and posterity, that the least detriment that could result from that, would be the suppression of essential items; endless multiplication in volume and number of those that should be suppressed; infection of the mass of the work by esprit de corps, which is ordinarily petty, jealous, concentrated; neglect of the arts; invasion of material of passing interest at the expense of the rest; and subjection of the Encyclopedia to the fate of so many works of controversy. When catholics and protestants, weary of disputes and surfeited with insults, opted for silence and calm, piles of famous books disappeared and were forgotten, as one watches the sediment of an abating fermentation settle to the bottom of a vessel.</p>
	<p> Such are the principal thoughts that came to my mind with regard to the project of a universal and analytical dictionary of human knowledge; its possibility, its purpose, its materials, the general and particular ordering of those materials, the style, method, references, nomenclature, the manuscript, the authors, the censors, the editors, and the typographer.</p>
	<p> If the importance of these objects be weighed, it will easily be seen that each could supply the matter of a very long discourse, that I have left more things to be said than I have said, and that prolixity and adulation will perhaps not be among the defects of which I may be accused.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> An encyclopedia or encyclopaedia is a type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge. Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries, which are usually arranged alphabetically by article name. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking, unlike dictionary entries which focus on linguistic information about words, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject for which the article is named.</p>
	<p> Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years; the oldest still in existence, Naturalis Historia, was written starting in ca. AD 77 by Pliny the Elder and was not fully revised at the time of his death in AD 79. The modern encyclopedia evolved out of dictionaries around the 17th century. Historically, some encyclopedias were contained in one volume, whereas others, such as the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Enciclopedia Italiana (62 volumes, 56,000 pages) or the world's largest, Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana (118 volumes, 105,000 pages), became huge multi-volume works. Some modern encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia, are often electronic and freely available.</p>
	<p> Etymology</p>
	<p> The word encyclopedia comes from the Koine Greek ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία, transliterated enkyklios paideia, meaning "general education" from enkyklios (ἐγκύκλιος), meaning "circular, recurrent, required regularly, general" and paideia (παιδεία), meaning "education, rearing of a child"; it was reduced to a single word due to an error by copyists of Latin manuscripts. Together, the phrase literally translates as "complete instruction" or "complete knowledge".</p>
	<p> Copyists of Latin manuscripts took this phrase to be a single Greek word, enkyklopaidia, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the New Latin word "encyclopaedia", which in turn came into English. Though the notion of a compendium of knowledge dates back thousands of years, the term was first used in the title of a book in 1517 by Johannes Aventinus: Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio, and in 1538 by Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius, Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia.</p>
	<p> The word encyclopaedia was first used as a noun in the title of his book by the Croatian encyclopedist Pavao Skalić in his Encyclopaedia seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam prophanarum epistemon (Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines, Basel, 1559). One of the oldest vernacular uses was by François Rabelais in his Pantagruel in 1532. Several encyclopedias have names that include the suffix -p(a)edia, e.g., Banglapedia (on matters relevant for Bangladesh).</p>
	<p> Today in English the word is most commonly spelled encyclopedia, though encyclopaedia (from encyclopædia) is also used in Britain.</p>
	<p> Characteristics</p>
	<p> The modern encyclopedia was developed from the dictionary in the 18th century. Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content experts, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of words and their definitions. Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.</p>
	<p> To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a subject or discipline. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.</p>
	<p> Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:</p>
	<p> Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language Encyclopædia Britannica and German Brockhaus are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and gazetteers. There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia Judaica.</p>
	<p> Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of medicine, philosophy, or law. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the target audience.</p>
	<p> Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the alphabetical method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by hierarchical categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, indexing and cross reference. The epigraph from Horace on the title page of the 18th century Encyclopédie suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: "What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection."</p>
	<p> As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as Everything2, Encarta, h2g2, and Wikipedia are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as information retrieval becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the Britannica was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the Wikimedia Foundation.</p>
	<p> Some works entitled "dictionaries" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary). The Macquarie Dictionary, Australia's national dictionary, became an encyclopedic dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.</p>
	<p> There are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries. There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide linguistic information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand. Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.</p>
	<p> In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, "encyclopedic" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries. Thus encyclopedias may contain material that is also found in dictionaries, and vice versa. In particular, dictionary entries often contain factual information about the thing named by the word.</p>
	<p> History</p>
	<p> Main article: History of encyclopedias</p>
	<p> Encyclopedias have progressed from written form in antiquity, to print in modern times. Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.</p>
	<p> Ancient times</p>
	<p> One of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77–79, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.</p>
	<p> Middle Ages</p>
	<p> Isidore of Seville, one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the Etymologiae (The Etymologies) or Origines (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.</p>
	<p> The most popular encyclopedia of the Carolingian Age was the De universo or De rerum naturis by Rabanus Maurus, written about 830; it was based on Etymologiae.</p>
	<p> The encyclopedia of Suda, a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.</p>
	<p> The early Muslim compilations of knowledge in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the Brethren of Purity of Basra were engaged in their Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity. Notable works include Abu Bakr al-Razi's encyclopedia of science, the Mutazilite Al-Kindi's prolific output of 270 books, and Ibn Sina's medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of universal history (or sociology) from Asharites, al-Tabri, al-Masudi, Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, Ibn Rustah, al-Athir, and Ibn Khaldun, whose Muqadimmah contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.</p>
	<p> The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the Four Great Books of Song, compiled by the 11th century AD during the early Song dynasty (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau, amounted to 9.4 million Chinese characters in 1000 written volumes.</p>
	<p> In late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example Bartholomew of England, Vincent of Beauvais, Radulfus Ardens, Sydrac, Brunetto Latini, Giovanni da Sangiminiano, Pierre Bersuire. Some were women, like Hildegard of Bingen and Herrad of Landsberg. The most successful of those publications were the Speculum maius (Great Mirror) of Vincent of Beauvais and the De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things) by Bartholomew of England. The latter was translated (or adapted) into French, Provençal, Italian, English, Flemish, Anglo-Norman, Spanish, and German during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title Encyclopaedia – they were often called On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum), Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale), Treasure (Trésor).</p>
	<p> Renaissance</p>
	<p> Medieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.</p>
	<p> During the Renaissance, the creation of printing allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The De expetendis et fugiendis rebus by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated. The Margarita Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.</p>
	<p> The term encyclopaedia was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of Pliny and Quintilian, and combined the two Greek words "enkyklios paideia" into one word, έγκυκλοπαιδεία. The phrase enkyklios paideia (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Encyclopedia came from him.</p>
	<p> The first work titled in this way was the Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio written by Johannes Aventinus in 1517.</p>
	<p> The English physician and philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne used the word 'encyclopaedia' in 1646 in the preface to the reader to define his Pseudodoxia Epidemica, a major work of the 17th-century scientific revolution. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. Pseudodoxia Epidemica was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.</p>
	<p> Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the Renaissance, middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher’s work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.</p>
	<p> 18th–19th centuries</p>
	<p> The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, Chambers' Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1728), and the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as Encyclopædia Britannica and the Conversations-Lexikon, were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's Lexicon Technicum of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".</p>
	<p> During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.</p>
	<p> 20th century</p>
	<p> Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia and the Children's Encyclopaedia appeared in the early 1920s.</p>
	<p> In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were World Book and Funk and Wagnalls.</p>
	<p> The second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all academic disciplines, including such narrow topics such as bioethics.</p>
	<p> By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers. Microsoft's Encarta, launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.</p>
	<p> 21st century</p>
	<p> In 2001, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia, a multilingual, open-source, free Internet encyclopedia supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as Britannica Online, which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively edited by volunteers. As of 30 May 2017, there are 5,415,337 articles in the English Wikipedia. There are 287 different editions of Wikipedia. As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month. Wikipedia has more than 25 million accounts, out of which there were over 118,000 active editors globally, as of August 2015. Wikipedia's accuracy was found by a Nature study to be close to that of Encyclopædia Britannica, with Wikipedia being much larger.</p>
	<p> However, critics argue Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias, (such as gender bias and racial bias) and its group dynamics hinder its goals. Many academics, historians, teachers, and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information, primarily for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some falsehoods, and that as a resource about many controversial topics, is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.</p>
	<p> While Wikipedia is by far the largest web-based encyclopedia, it is not the only one in existence. There are several much smaller, usually more specialized, encyclopedias on various themes, sometimes dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period. One example is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</p>`

	<p> Europe large region of the inhabited world. What is perhaps the best etymology derives the word Europe from the Phoenician urappa, which in that language means white face. One might have applied this epithet to the daughter of Agenor and sister of Cadmus, but at the very least it is appropriate for Europeans, those who are neither brown like South Asians nor black like Africans.</p>
	<p> Europe has not always had the same name nor has it had the same divisions with respect to the principal peoples who lived there. As for subdivisions, they depend on impossible details in the absence of historians who can show us the correct path out of this labyrinth.</p>
	<p> This article will not consider Europe as it was known by ancient writers whose works have survived to this day. I merely want to say a word here on its boundaries.</p>
	<p> It extends in its greatest width from Cape St. Vincent in the Portugese Algarve on the Atlantic Ocean to the mouth of the Obi on the Arctic Ocean with an expanse of 1200 French leagues, 20 to the degree, or of 900 German miles. Its largest length, taken from Cape Matapan in the south of Morea to the North Cape in the most northern part of Norway is about 733 French leagues, also 20 to the degree, or 550 German miles. It is bordered on the east by Asia, to the south by Africa, from which it is separated by the Mediterranean Sea, to the west by the Atlantic or Western Ocean, and to the north by the Arctic Ocean.</p>
	<p> I do not know if we are right to divide the world into four parts, of which Europe is one. At the very least, this division does not appear accurate because it could not include the arctic or Antarctic lands, which although less known than the rest do not cease to exist and merit an empty space on globes and maps.</p>
	<p> In any case, Europe is still the smallest part of the world; however, as noted by the author of The Spirit of Laws , it has come to such a high degree of power that history has almost nothing on it, considering the immensity of its expenditures, the greatness of its engagements, the number of troops and their continued maintenance in standing armies, even when they are most useless and kept only for ostentation.</p>
	<p> Besides, it matters little that Europe is the smallest of the four parts of the world in terms of terrain because it is the largest of all with respect to its commerce, its navigation, its fertility, by the enlightenment and industry of its peoples, by the knowledge of Art, Science, Trades, and most importantly because of Christianity, the goodness of whose morals only leads to the well-being of society. We owe this religion a certain political right in government and a certain law of nations in war that human nature cannot acknowledge enough; in appearing to have as its only objective bliss in another life, it is also responsible for our happiness in this one.<p> 
	<p> Europe was called Celtic in the earliest of times. Its location is between the 9 th and 93 rd degrees of longitude and between the 34 th and 73 rd degrees of north latitude. The geographers will teach the other details to the reader.</p>`,

	<p> Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The eastern boundary with Asia is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them; Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe—a concept dating back to classical antiquity—are arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term "continent" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.</p>
	<p> Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 740 million (about 11% of world population) as of 2015.</p>
	<p> The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p>
	<p> Europe, in particular ancient Greece, was the birthplace of Western civilization. The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. From the Age of Discovery onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p>
	<p> The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence. During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
	<p> In 1955, the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all states except for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation. The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The European Anthem is "Ode to Joy" and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Name</h4>
	<p> In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, Eurṓpē) is the name of either a Phoenician princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (eurús), "wide, broad" and ὤψ (ōps, gen. ὠπός, ōpós) "eye, face, countenance", hence their composite Eurṓpē would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect". Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it. For the second part compare also the divine attributes of "grey-eyed" Athena (γλαυκῶπις, glaukōpis) or ox-eyed Hera (βοὠπις, boōpis).</p>
	<p> There have been attempts to connect Eurṓpē to a Semitic term for "west", this being either Akkadian erebu meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or Phoenician 'ereb "evening, west", which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav. Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to Asu "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ανατολή (Anatolḗ "[sun] rise", "east", hence Anatolia). Martin Litchfield West stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor." Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto-Indo-European root *h1regʷos, meaning "darkness", which also produced Greek Erebus.</p>
	<p> Most major world languages use words derived from Eurṓpē or Europa to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word Ōuzhōu (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term Ōshū (欧州) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Ōshū Rengō (欧州連合?), despite the katakana Yōroppa (ヨーロッパ) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan ("land of the Franks") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Definition</h4>
	<h3> Contemporary definition</h3>
	<p> The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century. Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
	<p> Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.</p>
	<p> "Europe" as used specifically in British English may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> History of the concept</h3>
	<h2> Early history</h2>
	<p> The first recorded usage of Eurṓpē as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia. Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don. The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.</p>
	<p> The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy, who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.</p>
	<p> The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.</p>
	<p> A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy. The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: "Europa" often[dubious – discuss] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Modern definitions</h2>
	<p> The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of Muscovy began to include Northern Asia.</p>
	<p> Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the Turkish Straits, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and the Don (ancient Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.</p>
	<p> Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains. introducing the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard.</p>
	<p> The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.</p>
	<p> By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".</p>
	<p> In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906. In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression, thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe. However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<h3> Prehistory</h3>
	<p> Homo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe. Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain. Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around 43 to 40 thousand years ago.</p>
	<p> The European Neolithic period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East. It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture) and along the Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs. The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.</p>
	<p> The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BC in Greece with the Minoan civilization on Crete, the first advanced civilization in Europe. The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BC, ushering the European Iron Age. Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BC, the year the first Olympic Games.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Classical antiquity</h3>
	<p> Ancient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece. The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece. In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens. The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer; in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes. In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history, as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</p>
	<p> Greece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation. Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.</p>
	<p> The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes. The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions. This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD; or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Early Middle Ages</h3>
	<p> During the decline of the Roman Empire, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "Age of Migrations". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars. Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages". Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
	<p> While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia, and brought the Christian church under state control.</p>
	<p> From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region. Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy. Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule — save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.</p>
	<p> During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively. Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis I. Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "Holy Roman Emperor" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.</p>
	<p> East Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state. Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> High and Late Middle Ages</h3>
	<p> The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the High Middle Ages, during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the Renaissance of the 12th century. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.</p>
	<p> The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe. A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament. The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.</p>
	<p> The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land. In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
	<p> In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000. The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade. Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.</p>
	<p> In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east. Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols. The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries. After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans. From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.</p>
	<p> The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages. The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half. Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines, and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period. Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.</p>
	<p> The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers. The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century. During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Early modern period</h3>
	<p> The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin. The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, and an emerging merchant class. Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
	<p> Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.</p>
	<p> The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by the works of German theologian Martin Luther, an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths. This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population. In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.</p>
	<p> The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.[ Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700. From the Union of Krewo (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1648 and 1655 in the central and eastern Europe ended hegemony of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves. Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.</p>
	<p> The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development. Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton. According to Peter Barrett, "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world." In the 15th century, Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world. Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia. France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> 20th century to the present</h3>
	<p> Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip. Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead. Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.</p>
	<p> Russia was plunged into the Russian Revolution, which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union. Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.</p>
	<p> Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million. In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people; millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.</p>
	<p> The social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany, and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy, and in Ataturk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet, and state secularism. Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.</p>
	<p> In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of appeasement.</p>
	<p> With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of World War II. The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.</p>
	<p> In May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a bombing offensive on Britain, but failed to convince the Britons to give up. In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the Operation Barbarossa. On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire and other allied forces.</p>
	<p> After the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60 million dead across the world. More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II, including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the Holocaust. The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties. By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40 million refugees. Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.</p>
	<p> World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an "Iron Curtain". The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.</p>
	<p> The two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa. In the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.</p>
	<p> European integration also grew after World War II. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market. In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency. In 2004 and 2007, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Geography</h4>
	<p> Europe makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass. It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent. Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south. Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p>
	<p> This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Climate</h3>
	<p> Europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones, being subjected to prevailing westerlies. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
	<p> Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 12 °C (54 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk. Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a tempertate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is 9.05 °C (48.29 °F). However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of −6.5 °C (20.3 °F), giving it a nearly subarctic climate.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Geology</h3>
	<p> The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.</p>
	<p> The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary. Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea.</p>
	<p> The northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica, and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Flora</h3>
	<p> Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.</p>
	<p> The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these (Alps, Pyrenees) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north (Scandinavian Mountains, Dinarides, Carpathians, Apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.</p>
	<p> Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest. It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the broadleaf and mixed forests, taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).</p>
	<p> In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Fauna</h3>
	<p> Glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).</p>
	<p> European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).</p>
	<p> Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity.</p>
	<p> The extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the Mediterranean.</p>
	<p> Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton. Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton, molluscs, echinoderms, different crustaceans, squids and octopuses, fish, dolphins, and whales.</p>
	<p> Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention, which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Politics</h4>
	<p> The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is parliamentary democracy, in most cases in the form of Republic; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the Monarchy. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies are constitutional.</p>
	<p> European integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the Council of Europe since the end of World War II The European Union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the Eurasian Economic Union has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.</p>
	<p> 28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free Schengen Area and 19 of the monetary union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organizations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegrád Group.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Economy</h4>
	<p> As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008. In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak. As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the West; some of the Central and Eastern European economies are still emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p> The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. 18 EU countries share the euro as a common currency. Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP). This includes (ranks according to the CIA): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is Moldova with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010). Monaco is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Economic history</h3>
	<h2> Industrial growth (1760–1945)</h2>
	<p> Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism. From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe. The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century, and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.</p>
	<h2> Cold War (1945–1991)</h2>
	<p> After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin, and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades. Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s. France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco, also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle. The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON).</p>
	<p> The states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan. The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War. Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.</p>
	<h2> Reunification (1991–present)</h2>
	<p> With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia adopted them reasonably quickly, while Ukraine and Russia are still in the process of doing so.</p>
	<p> After East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.</p>
	<p> By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.</p>
	<p> Figures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008. It impacted much of the region. In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone. The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012. For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Demographics</h4>
	<p> In 2016, the population of Europe was estimated to be 738 million according to the United Nations, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population. The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia) the population has grown far more quickly. Among the continents, Europe has a relatively high population density, second only to Asia. The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the microstate of Monaco.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ethnic groups</h3>
	<p> Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653 million people (medium variant, 556 to 777 million in low and high variants, respectively). Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child bearing age is 1.52. According to some sources, this rate is higher among Muslims in Europe. The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Migration</h3>
	<p> Europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people, the IOM's report said. In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth. The European Union plans to open the job centres for legal migrant workers from Africa. In 2008, 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU27 member state, a decrease from 707,000 the previous year.</p>
	<p> Emigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century, and French and English settlers in the 17th century. But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.</p>
	<p> Today, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins). Australia and New Zealand have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably São Tomé and Príncipe, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in Northern Asia (specifically Russians), some parts of Northern Kazakhstan and Israel.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Languages</h3>
	<p> European languages mostly fall within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages.</p>
	<p> Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in Romania and Moldova, in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of Central Europe.</p>
	<p> Many other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the Baltic group (that is, Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (that is, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton), Greek, Armenian, and Albanian. In addition, a distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, and Hungary, while Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian, and Svan), are spoken primarily in Georgia, and two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar and Lezgin and Northwest Caucasian, notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani and Turkish, in addition to the languages of minority nations in Russia.</p>
	<p> Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Demographics</h4>
	<p> "Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the Roman Empire and its culture. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of Christendom (or more specifically Latin Christendom), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially against Islam, as in the Reconquista and the Ottoman wars in Europe.</p>
	<p> This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into Slavic, Latin (Romance) and Germanic, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably Greek and Celtic). Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".</p>
	<p> Europe is also the birthplace of the Western civilisation and culture. Although differencies exist from south to north and from east to west, have the different European people learned to know about each other through thousands of years. Not always peacefully however. But this can for instance be seen in the translation of names of other people, other countries, provinces and as well in towns and cities. Vienna is called "Wien" in German, Rome is called "Roma" in Italian, Brittany is called "Bretagne" in French, Poland is called "Polska" in Polish and (most of) the Spaniards are calling themselves "Españoles" etc. Translations of such names (by Europeans) in other civilisations are very rare. (And those who appear to be translated are instead usually invented or changed by Europeans, like for instance Johannesburg) Music, classical as well as hymns, and art have crossed language borders for centuries. Europeans traditionally eat with a knife in their right hand and a fork in the left - which can be compared with how east Asians eat with chopsticks. Most Europeans consider Football as the most popular sport in their respective countries. Much of European culture can also be found in America and at other places which the Europeans have populated. Europeans have though also imported importaint matters, like the figures, from the Arabs. (And the Arabs had got them from the Persians, who had got them from Sanskrit) But almost all languages spoken in Europe gives credit to the Arabs for the figures. Also the use of inventions and science have spread across the continent from the "Old Greeks" like Archimedes and Pythagoras to Isaac Newton, Carl von Linneus, Niels Bohr and Wilhelm Röntgen, just to mention a few. And most of the exploration of the world must also be counted as a European invention which indeed has affected European culture.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Religion</h3>
	<p> Historically, religion in Europe has been a major influence on European art, culture, philosophy and law.</p>
	<p> The largest religion in Europe is Christianity, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians, including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and various Protestant denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as Lutheranism, Anglicanism and the Reformed faith. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like Anabaptists were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the United States such as Pentecostalism, Adventism, Methodism, Baptists and various Evangelical Protestants; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "Christianity and Christendom"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.</p>
	<p> Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization since at least the 4th century, and for at least a millennium and a half, Europe has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, even though the religion was inherited from the Middle East. Christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science.</p>
	<p> The second most popular religion is Islam (6%) concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, North Cyprus, Turkey, Azerbaijan, North Caucasus, and the Volga-Ural region). Other religions, including Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia). The 20th century saw the revival of Neopaganism through movements such as Wicca and Druidry.</p>
	<p> Europe has become a relatively secular continent, with an increasing number and proportion of irreligious, atheist and agnostic people, who make up about 18.2% of Europe's population, actually the largest secular population in the Western world. There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Sweden, former East Germany, and France.</p>`

	<p> History is the narrative (récit) of facts presented as true, in contrast to the fable, which is the recitation (récit) of facts presented as false.</p>
	<p> There is the history of opinions, which is hardly other than the collection of human errors; the history of the arts, perhaps the most useful of all when it is joined to the knowledge of inventions and the progress of the arts, and which is the description of their mechanism; natural History , inappropriately termed history , and which is an essential part of Physics.</p>
	<p> The history of events is divided into the sacred and the profane. Sacred history is the series (suite) of divine and miraculous operations, by which it pleased God in the past to conduct the Jewish nation and to exercise our faith today. I will not touch upon this respectable matter.</p>
	<p> The basic (premiers) foundations of all History are the stories recounted by fathers to their children, and subsequently transmitted from one generation to the next. They are merely probable in their origins and lose a degree of probability with each succeeding generation. Over time, the fable grows and the truth is lost; hence the origins of all peoples are absurd. Thus the Egyptians were governed by the gods for many centuries, then by demi-gods, and finally they had kings who ruled them for eleven thousand three hundred and forty years. The sun, in this period of time, had changed where it rose in the east and set [in the west] four times.</p>
	<p> The Phoenicians claimed to have been settled in their country for thirty thousand years, and these thirty thousand years were as full of marvels (prodiges) as the Egyptian chronology (chronogie). It is well known what ridiculous tales of superstition reign in the ancient history of the Greeks. The Romans—as serious as they were—did not shroud the history of their earliest centuries in fables any less than the others. Such a recent people, in comparison to some asiatic nations, went without historians for five hundred years.</p>
	<p> Thus it is not surprising that Romulus was the son of Mars and that a female wolf was his wet-nurse; or that he marched (marché) with twenty-thousand men from his village of Rome against twenty-five thousand combatants from the village of the Sabines, and that he then became a god; or that Tarquin cut a rock with a razor, or that a vestal virgin pulled a boat onto land with only a belt, et cetera.</p>
	<p> The earliest annals of all our modern nations are no less fabulous. These marvelous and improbable things should be reported, but [only] as proofs of human credulity, and they fall within the history of opinions.</p>
	<p> There is only one way to know something with certitude about ancient history , and that is to see if there remain any incontestable historical monuments (monumens). [1] We only have three such written records. The first is the collection of astronomical observations assembled over a nineteen-hundred year period in Babylon, sent by Alexander to Greece, and employed in the Almagest of Ptolemy. This succession of observations goes back two thousand two hundred and thirty four years before the common era, and incontrovertibly proves that the Babylonians existed long beforehand as a constituted people: because the arts are only the work of time, and because man's natural laziness left him for thousands of years with no other knowledge and no other talents than feeding himself, defending himself from the climate, and cutting the throats [of his neighbors]. [2] Looking at the Germanic tribes, the English in the time of Caesar, the Tartars of the present day, half of Africa, and all the peoples who we have found in America, excepting, in certain regards, the kingdoms of Peru and Mexico and the republic of Tlaxcala, leads to this conclusion.</p>
	<p> The second record (monument) is the complete eclipse of the sun calculated in China two thousand five hundred and fifty five years before the common era, and recognized as true by all of our astronomers. It is necessary to say the same thing about the Chinese [as we said of the peoples of Babylon], who without a doubt composed a vast and well-administered (policé) empire. Yet what places the Chinese above all other peoples of the earth is that neither their laws nor their customs (moeurs), nor the language spoken by their men of letters (lettrés), has changed for roughly four thousand years. However, this nation—the oldest of all the peoples who exist today, the one that possessed the most vast and beautiful country, the one that invented practically all of the arts (Arts) before we had even learned a few—has always been omitted, up until now, from our so-called universal histories : when a Spaniard and a Frenchman took count of the world's nations, neither failed to call his country the first monarchy of the world.</p>
	<p> The third record (monument), much inferior to the two others, persists in the marble [friezes] of Arundel: the chronicle of Athens was engraved there two hundred and sixty three years before the common era. Yet it only goes back to Cecrops, thirteen hundred and nineteen years before the date when it was chiseled. This is the only incontestable knowledge that we have of the history of antiquity.</p>
	<p> It is not surprising that we do not possess a secular (profane), ancient history that goes back more than approximately three thousand years. The revolutions of the globe [and] the long and universal ignorance of the art of transmitting facts through writing is the cause [of this absence]. There are still several peoples who have no such practice. This art was only common amongst a small number of well-administered (policé) nations, and was only in the hands of a precious few. Until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, there was nothing more rare amongst the French and the Germans than the ability to write. Almost all actions (actes) were attested only by witnesses. In France, it was only under Charles VII in 1454 that French customs (coûtumes) were written down. The art of writing was even rarer amongst the Spanish, which is why their history is so insipid and uncertain up until the time of Ferdinand and Isabella. This shows just how much power (imposer) was wielded by the small number of men who knew how to write.</p>
	<p> There are some nations who have subjugated a part of the earth without the use of [written] characters. We know that Ghengis Khan conquered part of Asia at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Yet it is not through him nor through the Tartars that we know this. Their history , written by the Chinese and translated by father Gaubil, says that the Tartars did not possess at all the art of writing.</p>
	<p> It was no less unknown to the Scythian Ogus-kan, named Madies by the Persians and the Greeks, who conquered a part of Europe and Asia so long before the reign of Cyrus.</p>
	<p> It is almost certain that at that time hardly two out of a hundred nations could use [written] characters.</p></p>
	<p> There remain some records of a different sort, which serve only to certify the remote antiquity of certain peoples who precede all books and all known epochs. Such are the marvels of architecture, like the pyramids and the palaces of Egypt which have withstood time. Herodotus, who lived two thousand two hundred years ago, and who had seen them, was not able to learn from Egyptian priests the period in which they had been constructed.</p>
	<p> It would be difficult to argue that the oldest of the pyramids is less than four thousand years old. But one must consider that such ostentatious efforts by kings could only have begun long after the establishment of cities. And to build cities in a country that floods every year, it was first necessary to elevate the terrain. Then, to render them inaccessible to floods in this land of mud, they had to use stilts as the foundations for [their] cities. Before taking this necessary course of action, and before being in a position to attempt these enormous construction projects, it was necessary that the people build some retreats in the middle of rocks which form two chains to the right and the left of the river, during periods when the Nile flooded. These people, when gathered together, had to have tools for plowing, for architecture, and [required] an extensive knowledge of surveying, laws, and a rational administration (police). All of this required a prodigious amount of time. We see from the numerous details impeding each day just how difficult it is to accomplish great things, [or even] the smallest and most necessary of our undertakings. One must not only possess an indefatigable persistence, but several generations animated by this persistence.</p>
	<p> However the history of Egypt does not teach us whether it was Menes, Thoth, Cheops, or Ramesses who erected one or two of these prodigious masses. The language of this people is lost. We only know that before the oldest historians existed, there was without a doubt an ancient history.</p>
	<p> What we call ancient , and which is in effect recent, hardly goes back three thousand years. Before this time we only have probable knowledge. Only two secular books have preserved these probabilities : the Chinese chronicle and the history of Herodotus. The ancient Chinese chronicles only deal with their empire as separated from the rest of the world. Herodotus, more interesting for us, speaks of lands already known. He delighted the Greeks by reciting to them the nine books of his history , by the novelty of this undertaking, by the charm of his diction, and above all by his fables. Almost everything that he recounts on the word (foi) of foreigners is a fantasy (fabuleux), but everything he [himself] saw was true. We learn from him, for example, what extreme opulence and what splendor reigned in Asia Minor, today so poor and depopulated. He saw at Delphi the marvelous gifts of gold that the kings of Lydia sent there, and he spoke to an audience who knew Delphi as he did. What stretch of time must have passed before the kings of Lydia could have amassed enough surplus treasure to offer such considerable presents to a foreign temple!</p>
	<p> But when Herodotus recounts the stories he heard, his book reads like a novel resembling Milesian fables. He tells us of a certain Candaules who shows his wife stark naked to a friend, Gyges. It is his wife who, out of modesty, allows Gyges only the choice of killing her husband and marrying the [resulting] widow, or of death. He speaks of an oracle at Delphi who divines that at the same time that he spoke, Croesus, one hundred leagues away, cooked a tortoise on a plate of bronze. Rollin, repeats all the stories of this sort, admires the knowledge (science) of the oracle and the veracity of Apollo, as well as the modesty of the wife of the king Candaules. On a related subject, he asks the police to prevent young people from bathing in the river. Time is so dear and history is so immense that I will spare the reader such fables and parables (moralités).</p>
	<p> The history of Cyrus is completely disfigured (défigurée) by mythical fables. It would appear that this Kiro, called Cyrus , at the head of the warrior people of Elam, in effect conquered a Babylon weakened by luxuries. But we don't even know which king reigned in Babylon at that time. Some say Baltazar; others Anabot. Herodotus says that Cyrus was killed in an expedition against the Massagetae; Xenophon, in his moral and political novel, says that he died in his bed.</p>
	<p> In the shadows of history nothing is known except that there were vast empires that lasted a very long time; that there were tyrants whose power was based on public misery; that tyranny was so extensive that it reached the point of stripping men of their virility, to use them for infamous pleasures starting at the end of their childhood, and to employ them in their old age to guard women; that superstition governed men; that a dream (songe) was regarded as a sign (avis) from above, and that this would govern peace and war, etc.</p>
	<p> The closer that Herodotus comes to his own time, the truer and more informed his history becomes. One must confess that history , for us, only begins with Persia's ventures against the Greeks. Before these great events, one only finds vague narratives (récits) shrouded in puerile tales. Herodotus becomes the model historian when he describes the prodigious preparations [undertaken by] Xerxes to subjugate Greece and then Europe. Xerxes led close to two million soldiers from Susa to Athens, and Herodotus teaches us how [Xerxes] armed so many different peoples employed in his ranks. No one was forgotten, from the farthest reaches of Arabia and Egypt and beyond Bactria, to the northern extremity of the Caspian Sea—a country inhabited then by powerful peoples and today by vagabond Tartars. All nations, from the Bosphorus of Thrace to the Ganges, were under his banner. One notes with surprise that this prince possessed as much territory as the Roman Empire. He controlled everything that today belongs to the great mogul on this side of the Ganges: all of Persia, all of the country of Uzbek, and all of the empire of the Turks, excepting Romania; [yet] he compensated for this by possessing Arabia. One sees by the extent of these holdings (états) the mistaken ways of those critics (déclamateurs), in prose and in verse, who treated Alexander—avenger of Greece—as crazy for having subjugated the empire of the enemy of the Greeks.</p>
	<p> Herodotus deserves the same credit as Homer. He was the first historian just as Homer was the first epic poet. Each seized the peculiar beauties of an art unknown before their time. It is an admirable spectacle in [the work of] Herodotus [to read about] that emperor of Asia and Africa, who had his immense army pass from Asia to Europe on a bridge of boats, who took Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, upper Achaea, and who entered into an Athens abandoned and deserted. One wouldn't expect that the Athenians, without a city, without any territory, taking refuge on their ships with some other Greeks, could cause the massive navy of the great king to flee, or that the Greeks would re-enter their homeland as victors, or that they would force Xerxes to ignominiously retreat with his fragmented army, or that they would forbid him, by treaty, to navigate on their seas. The superiority of this small, generous, and free people over all of enslaved Asia, is perhaps the most glorious thing amongst men. One learns as well from this event that the peoples of the West have always been better sailors than the peoples of Asia. When one reads modern history , the victory of Lepanto reminds us of that of Salamis, and one compares Don Juan of Austria and Colonus to Themistocles and Eurybiades. This is perhaps the sole fruit that one can harvest from the knowledge of these remote times.</p>
	<p> Thucydides, successor of Herodotus, limits himself to detailing the history of the Peloponnesian War, fought in a country no larger than a French or German province. Yet this province has produced men of all sorts worthy of their immortal reputation. Yet if civil war, the most horrible scourge, added a new light (feu) and new spirit (ressorts) to the human mind, it is [also at] this time that all the arts flourished in Greece. Just as the arts began to perfect themselves [amidst civil war in Greece], [the same process took place] in Rome amidst another civil war, and yet again in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries of the common era, during the wars of the Reformation during the disturbances in Italy.</p>
	<p> After the Peloponnesian War, described by Thucydides, comes the celebrated time of Alexander—a prince worthy of a tutor such as Aristotle—who founded more towns than others had destroyed and who transformed the commerce (commerce) of the universe. Carthage flourished in the time of Alexander and his successors, and the Roman republic led other nations in admiring her. All the rest is buried in barbarism : the Celts, the Germans, and all the peoples of the north are unknown.</p>
	<p> The history of the Roman empire deserves the most attention because the Romans are our masters and legislators. Their laws are still current (en vigueur) in most of our provinces. Their language is still spoken, and long after their fall, Latin is the sole language in which public acts are written in Italy, Germany, Spain, France, England, and Poland.</p>
	<p> With the breaking up of the Roman empire (au démembrement) in the West, a new order of things began, which is commonly referred to as the history of the middle ages : a barbarian history of barbarian peoples, who, becoming Christian, [nonetheless] became no better.</p>
	<p> While Europe turned upside down, one sees the appearance of the Arabs in the seventh century, who had up until that point stayed in their deserts. They extended their power and domination into upper Asia (haute Asie) and Africa, and invaded Spain. The Turks succeeded them and in the middle of the fifteenth century established the capital of their empire in Constantinople.</p>
	<p> At the end of that century a new world was discovered, and European politics and arts soon took on a new form. The art of printing and the restoration (restauration) of the sciences allowed trustworthy histories to be produced, unlike the ridiculous chronicles held in cloisters since [the time of] Gregory of Tours. Soon, each European nation had historians. The old privation (indigence) turned to superfluity; every town wanted its own individual history. One is overwhelmed under the weight of minute details. A man who wants instruction is forced to confine himself to [studying] great events, and [must] brush aside all the minor facts that get in the way. He [must] seize, in the plethora of revolutions, the spirit of the time (l'esprit des tems) and the customs (moeurs) of various peoples. Above all, one must attach oneself to the history of one's homeland, study it, possess it, reserve detailed [analysis] for it alone, and take only a more general look at other nations. The history of other nations is only interesting when it relates to us, or when great things occurred there. The ages after the fall of the Roman Empire, as one has elsewhere remarked, are only barbarous adventures (avantures) under barbarous names, excepting the time of Charlemagne. England remained practically isolated until the time of Edward III. The northern countries (le Nord) were savage until the sixteenth century, and Germany was in anarchy for a long time. The quarrels of emperors and popes ravaged (desolent) Italy for six hundred years. It is difficult to detect the truth in the passions of the unlearned (peu instruit) writers who have written ill-constructed (informes) chronicles of this miserable time. The Spanish monarchy witnessed only one [noteworthy] event under the Visigoth kings, and that was its destruction. Everything was confusion until the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand. Until Louis XI, France fell victim to (en proie à) the dark misfortunes of an unregulated government. Daniel tried hard to argue that the early periods of France were more interesting than those of Rome. He failed to notice that the beginnings of a vast empire are all the more interesting because of their inherent weaknesses, and because people like to see the source of a stream that flooded half the earth.</p>
	<p> To penetrate the dark labyrinth of the middle ages, one must have recourse to archives, and yet we have so very few. Some of the older convents have conserved charters and diplomas, which were gifts and of which the authority is contested. It is not by using these collections that one can enlighten oneself about political history or public law in Europe. Of all countries, England is the one who has, without a doubt, the oldest and the most complete (suivies) archives. These documents, collected by Rimer under the auspices of Queen Anne, begin in the twelfth century and continue without interruption up to the present day. They shed an abundance of light on the history of France. They reveal, for example, that Guyana belonged to the English with absolute sovereignty, when the king of France, Charles V, confiscated it by decree and seized it by force of arms. One also learns about the considerable sums [of money] and sorts of tributes that Louis XI paid to king Edward IV so that he could fight, and how much money queen Elizabeth loaned to Henry the Great to aid his accession to the throne, et cetera.</p>
	<p> Concerning the utility (utilité) of History. Its usefulness is seen when a statesman (homme d'état) or a citizen compares foreign laws and customs with those of his own country. This is what motivates (excite) modern nations to spend more lavishly (enchérir) on arts, commerce, and Agriculture than other [countries]. Great faults of the past are very useful. We are always placing in front of our eyes the crimes and the miseries caused by absurd quarrels. It is certain that by dint of renewing the memory of these quarrels, we can prevent them from happening again.</p>
	<p> It is from having studied the details of the battles of Crécy, of Poitiers, of Agincourt, of Saint-Quentin, of Gravelines, et cetera, that the celebrated maréchal de Saxe decided to opt for, as much as he could, what one calls des affaires de poste. [3]</p>
	<p> Such examples [can] have a great effect on the mind of a prince who reads attentively. He will see that Henry IV only undertook his great war—which changed the system of Europe—after having sufficiently assured himself that he could fight the war for several years without the help of any [extra] financial aid.</p>
	<p> The prince will see that Queen Elizabeth, through the sole resources of commerce and a wise economy, resisted the powerful Philip II, and that of the one hundred boats that she put to sea against his invincible navy, three out of four were furnished by England's commercial towns.</p></p>
	<p> France, [remaining] untouched after nine years of the most miserable war under Louis XIV, clearly demonstrates the utility of border defenses (places) [such as the ones] that Louis constructed. An author [searching for] the causes of the fall of the Roman empire will blame Justinian in vain for having maintained the same political strategy as Louis XIV. It is necessary to blame only those emperors who neglected such border fortresses (places), and who thus opened the gates of the empire to the barbarians.</p></p>
	<p> Finally, the great utility of modern history , and the advantage that it has over its ancient counterpart, is to teach all autocratic rulers (potentats) that since the fifteenth century, [nations have] repeatedly united against a power that becomes too preponderant. This system of equilibrium was unknown to the ancients, and this is why the Romans were so successful. They formed an armed force (milice) superior to all other peoples and subjugated them, one after the other, from the Tiber to the Euphrates.</p></p>
	<p> Concerning the certainty (certitude) of history. All certainty which is not mathematically demonstrable is only a distant (extrème) probability. There is no other historical certainty.</p></p>
	<p> When Marco Polo first spoke—and he was the only one—of the grandeur and population of China, he was not believed nor could he command belief. The Portuguese who entered into this vast empire several centuries later began to demonstrate the probability of his assertions. Today it is certain, and our certainty is born from a unanimous disposition of a thousand first-hand witnesses from different nations, who have never contradicted each another in their testimony.</p>
	<p> If two or three historians alone had written about the adventure of King Charles XII who, despite himself, insisted on remaining in the states of the Sultan—his benefactor—and who battled with his servants against an army of Janissaries and Tartars, I would have suspended my judgment; but having spoken to several eye-witnesses, and having never heard this action placed in doubt, it is necessary to believe it, because after all, if it is not wise or ordinary, then it does not contradict the laws of nature nor the character of heroes.</p></p>
	<p> I would have taken the history of the Man in the Iron Mask for a novel if I had not heard it from the son-in-law of the surgeon who took care of this man during his last illness. The officer who guarded the man at that time also attested this fact to me. [Indeed] all those who knew of the man have confirmed its veracity to me; the children of the ministers of state who are still alive are depositaries of this secret and have been told of it as I have. I have given this history a high degree of probability, yet not as high as the Bender affair, because the Bender adventure had more witnesses than our man in the iron mask ever did.</p></p>
	<p> That which contradicts (répugne) the ordinary course of nature must not be believed, unless it is attested by men moved by the divine spirit. That is why in the article Certitude of this Dictionary, it is a great paradox to say that one should equally believe all of Paris when it affirms having seen a dead man resuscitated, as it would be to believe all of Paris when it says that someone has won the battle of Fontenoy. It appears evident that the testimony of all Paris on an improbable thing would not equal the testimony of all Paris on a probable thing. These are the basic notions of a sane Metaphysics. This Dictionary is dedicated to the truth; one article must correct another, and if an error is found here then it must be repaired by a more enlightened man.</p></p>  
	<p> Concerning the Uncertainty of History. We have distinguished between historical and fabulous (fabuleux) epochs. But historical periods should themselves be distinguished between truths and fables. I do not speak here of fables that are recognized as such. It is not a question, for example, of the prodigies with which Livy embellished or spoiled his history. But amongst the most well-known facts, how many do we have reason to doubt? We should take note that the Roman republic went five hundred years without an historian, and that Livy himself deplored the loss of the annals of the pontiffs and of other records (monumens), most of which perished in the fire of Rome, pleraque interiere [a great many things]. One must remember (qu'on songe) that in the first three hundred years, the art of writing was very rare, rarae per eadem tempora litterae [letters were rare throughout those times]. We may be permitted to doubt all events from that period which were not in the ordinary order of human things. Is it at all probable that Romulus, the grandson of the king of the Sabines, would have been forced to remove some of the Sabine women in order for [the Romans] to have wives. Is Lucretius' history really all that probable? Can one easily believe Livy [when he says] that the king Porsenna fled full of admiration for the Romans because a fanatic had wanted to assassinate him? Should one not be inclined towards the contrary and believe Polybius, who predates Livy by two hundred years, and who says that Porsenna subjugated the Romans? The adventure of Regulus, [who was] locked in a barrel with iron spikes by the Carthaginians—does that merit belief? Wouldn't Polybius—a contemporary—have spoken of it if it had been true? He doesn't say a word about it. Isn't it highly likely that this story was only invented long after to render the Carthaginians odious? Open the dictionary of Moréri to the article "Régulus," and it will assure you that the torture of this Roman is reported in Livy. However the Decade where Livy could have spoken of it has been lost. All we have is Freinsemius' supplement, and it turns out that that dictionary was only citing a German from the seventeenth century, [while Freinsemius] believed [that we was] quoting a Roman from the time of Augustus. One could make immense volumes out of all the received and celebrated facts which are worthy of doubt. But the limits of this article do not permit further [elaboration].</p></p>
	<p> Monuments (monumens), annual ceremonies, even medals—do these constitute historical evidence ? One is naturally inclined to believe that a monument erected by a nation to celebrate an event attests to the certitude of the event. However if these monuments were not erected by contemporaries, [or] if they celebrate an improbable occurrence, is it proof of anything other than the consecration a popular opinion?</p>
	<p> The rostral column erected in Rome by the contemporaries of Duilius is without a doubt proof of his naval victory. But the statue of the soothsayer (augure) Navius, who cut a stone with a razor (rasoir), does this prove that Navius undertook such a marvel? The statues of Ceres and of Triptolemus in Athens, do they bear incontestable witness that Ceres taught Agriculture to the Athenians? The famous "Laocoön," which exists today in its entirety, does it attest to the truth of the history of the Trojan horse?</p>
	<p> The origins of ceremonies and annual holidays, established by every nation, are no easier to prove. The feast of Arion, [who was] carried on [the back of] a dolphin, was celebrated by the Romans and the Greeks. That of Faunus recalls his adventure with Hercules and Omphale, when this god, in love with Omphale, mistook Hercules' bed for that of his mistress.</p>
	<p> The famous festival of Lupercalia was established in honor of the wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus.</p>
	<p> What was the festival of Orion based upon, celebrated on the fifth of the ides of May? I'll explain. Hyreius welcomed Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury into his home, and when his guests took their leave, this good man, who had no wife, and who wanted a child, recounted (témoigna) his woe (douleur) to the three gods. One dare not explain what they did to the skin of the beef that Hyreius had served them for dinner. They then covered the skin with some soil, and from that Orion was born nine months later.</p>
	<p> Almost all Roman, Syrian, Greek, and Egyptian festivals were based upon similar stories, as were the temples and statues of ancient heroes. They were monuments that credulity consecrated to error.</p>
	<p> Even a contemporary medal is not necessarily proof of anything. How many medals have been struck out of flattery [to commemorate] indecisive battles, qualified victories, or failed undertakings, which were [successfully] realized (achevées) only in legend. Is it not true, for example, that during the war of 1740 between the English and the Spanish that a medal was struck that represented the taking of Cartagena by Admiral Vernon, whereas [in reality] this admiral lifted his siege?</p>
	<p> Medals are only incontestable evidence (témoignages irréprochables) when the event is attested by a contemporary author. Then, these proofs, by supporting each other, reveal the truth.</p>
	<p> In [the writing of] history , should one insert harangues and construct portraits ? If, on an important occasion, a general [or] a man of state has spoken in a singular and strong manner which characterizes his genius and that of his century, then it is necessary to report his discourse word for word. Such harangues are perhaps the most useful part of history. But why attribute to a man something that he has not said? It would almost be better to attribute to him something that he has not done. This is a fiction that derives from Homer. Yet what is fictitious in a poem becomes a lie for the historian. Several ancients used this method, and this proves nothing except that several of the ancients wanted to parade their eloquence at the expense of the truth.</p>
	<p> Portraits often show the desire to dazzle, not to instruct. Contemporaries are right to make portraits of men of state with whom they have conducted business, or generals under whom they have fought wars. Yet one should fear the paint brush guided by passion! It appears that the portraits that one finds in Clarendon are made with more impartiality, gravity, and wisdom than those that one reads with pleasure in the Cardinal de Retz.</p>
	<p> But to wish to portray the ancients [or] to try hard to develop [an understanding of] their souls [or] to look at events as characteristics with which one can surely read into the depths of their hearts, this is a very delicate task, and in several works it is a puerility.</p>
	<p> On Cicero's maxim concerning history ; that the historian dare not speak a falsity nor obscure a verity. The first part of this precept is incontestable; we must examine the other. If a truth can be of some utility to the state, your silence is condemnable. But suppose you write the history of a prince who has entrusted a secret to you; should you reveal it? Should you inform posterity [of something] that would render you guilty if you were to speak of it in secret to an single man? Does the duty of the historian override a higher duty?</p>
	<p> Or suppose that you have witnessed a foible which has had no influence on public affairs; would you reveal this foible? If so, history would be a satire.</p>
	<p> One must confess that the majority of writers of anecdotes are more indiscreet than useful. But what can one say of these insolent compilers, who pride themselves on scandalmongering, printing, and selling scandal [sheets], as Lecauste sold poisons.</p>
	<p> On satirical history. If Plutarch criticized Herodotus for not having sufficiently exalted the glory of certain Greek villages, and for having omitted several facts worthy of memory, how much more reprehensible are those today who, without having the merits of Herodotus, ascribe odious actions to princes and nations, without the slightest shred of evidence. The war of 1741 has been written on in England. One finds in this history that at the battle of Fontenoy the French fired on the English with poisoned bullets and pieces of poisoned glass (verre venimeux), and that the Duke of Cumberland sent to the king of France a shred (boëte) full of these alleged poisons found in the bodies of the wounded English soldiers. The same author adds that when the French lost forty thousand men in this battle, the parlement of Paris proffered a decree that forbade mentioning the battle under pain of death.</p>
	<p> Fraudulent memoirs, a new phenomenon, are full of equally insolent absurdities. One discovers in them that at the siege of Lille the allies distributed notes in the city that said the following: Frenchmen, console yourselves, Madame de Maintenon will not be your queen.</p>
	<p> Almost every page is full of impostures and offensive words directed at the royal family and the principal families of the kingdom, without putting forward the least verisimilitude which could give the slightest color to these lies. This is not to write history but to write calumnies at random.</p>
	<p> In Holland a collection of libelous literature (libelles) has been published under the name of history , in which the style is as crude as the insults, and the facts are as false as they are poorly written. It has been said by some that this is [merely] the bad fruit of the excellent tree of liberty. But if the miserable authors of these idiocies have had the freedom to deceive the reader, [then] we must use [the same] freedom to disabuse them.</p>
	<p> Of the method and manner of writing history , and of style. So much has been said of this matter that it is necessary here to say very little. It is well known that the method and style of Livy, his gravity and wise eloquence, suits the majesty of the Roman republic; that Tacitus is better at depicting tyrants; Polybius better at giving lessons on warfare; Denys 'Halycarnasse Dionysius of Halicarnassus better at elaborating on antiquities.</p>
	<p> But in modeling oneself in general upon these great masters, we have today a more onerous burden than theirs. The modern historian is required to furnish more detail, more certifiable facts, precise dates, authority (autorité), greater attention to customs, laws, morals, commerce, finance, agriculture, and population. History in this way has become like Mathematics and Physics. The field (carriere) has grown prodigiously. It is now as difficult to write history as it is easy to make a collection of gazettes.</p>
	<p> It is required that the history of a foreign country not be cast in the same mould as that of one's homeland (patrie).</p>
	<p> If you write the history of France, you are not required to describe the course of the Seine and the Loire. But if you give to the public [the history of] the conquests of the Portuguese in Asia, you need a topography of the discovered countries. People want you to lead your reader by the hand along the coasts of Africa, Persia, and India; they expect some descriptions of the morals (moeurs), laws, customs (usages) of these nations that are so new to Europe.</p>
	<p> We have twenty histories of the establishment of the Portuguese in the Indies. Yet none have made us familiar with the diverse governments of this country, its religions, antiquities, the Brahmins, the disciples of John, the Guebres, the Banians. This observation could be applied to all the histories of foreign countries.</p>
	<p> If you have nothing to tell us other than that one Barbarian (Barbare) has replaced another Barbarian on the banks of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, in what way are you useful to the public?</p>
	<p> The method suitable to [the writing of] the history of your country does not [require] you to write on the discoveries of the new world. You should not write about a village as you would about a great empire; you should not write of the life of an individual as you would write the history of Spain or England.</p>
	<p> These rules are well known. But the art of writing History well will always be rare. It is well known that one must have a grave, pure, varied, agreeable style. There are laws for writing History just as there are laws for all the arts of the mind. There are many precepts and yet so few great artists.</p>`,
	wArt:`
	<p> History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.</p>
	<p> History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on the problems of the present.</p>
	<p> Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history. Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the "father of history", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.</p>
	<p> Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Geology</h4>
	<p> The word history comes ultimately from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía), meaning "inquiry","knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι (Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).</p>
	<p> The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning 'investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative'. History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.</p>
	<p> Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and historie, with new developments in the meaning: 'account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)'.</p>
	<p> It was from Anglo-Norman that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century Ancrene Wisse, but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in John Gower's Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383): 'I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire'. In Middle English, the meaning of history was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning 'the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs' arose in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>
	<p> With the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "Natural History". For him, historia was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).</p>
	<p> In an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".</p>
	<p> The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669.</p>
	<p> Historian in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all European languages, the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word historiography.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Description</h4>
	<br>
	<p> Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race. The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.</p>
	<p> All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record. The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').</p>
	<p> The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences. It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification. In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.</p>
	<p> Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three. But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.</p>
	<p> Archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.</p>
	<p> There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History and prehistory</h4>
	<p> The history of the world is the memory of the past experience of Homo sapiens sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world. In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr wrote:</p>
	<p> The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.</p>
	<p> This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Indigenous Australians and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Historiography</h4>
	<p> Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the Philosophy of history. As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, world view, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Philosophy of history</h4>
	<p> Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy, which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Historical methods</h4>
	<p> The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.</p>
	<p> Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC – ca.425 BC) has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary Thucydides (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention. In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.</p>
	<p> There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China. The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the Han dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese historiography. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.</p>

	<p> Saint Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.</p>
	<p> In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science". His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography" or the "father of the philosophy of history".</p>
	<p> In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was Leopold von Ranke in Germany.</p>
	<p> In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien Febvre and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.</p>
	<p> In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of social history to emerge in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period.</p>
	<p> Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton, Georges Lefebvre, Eugene Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason, Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans, a professor of modern history at Cambridge University, defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Marxian theory of history</h4>
	<p> The Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families. Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe. Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Areas of study</h4>
	<h3> Periods</h3>
	<p> Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians. The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. Centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Prehistoric periodisation</h3>
	<p> The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Geographical locations</h3>
	<p> Particular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, continents, countries and cities. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to geography. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.</p>

	<h3> Regions</h3>
	<p> • History of Africa begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.</p>
	<p> • History of the Americas is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

	<br>
	<h3> Regions</h3>
	<p> Military history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> History of religion</h3>
	<p> The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History, The Catholic Historical Review, and History of Religions. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy. This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Social history</h3>
	<p> Social history, sometimes called the new social history, is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%. In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%). The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men. English historian G. M. Trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible." While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Subfields</h3>
	<p> The chief subfields of social history include:</p>
	<p> • Demographic history</p>
	<p> • History of education</p>
	<p> • Ethnic history</p>
	<p> • History of the family</p>
	<p> • Labour history</p>
	<p> • Rural history</p>
	<p> • Urban history</p>
	<p> • American urban history</p>
	<p> • Women's history</p>
	<p> Smaller specialties include:</p>
	<p> • History of childhood</p>
	<p> • Gender history</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Cultural history</h3>
	<p> Cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic. Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Diplomatic history</h3>
	<p> Diplomatic history focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies." She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Economic history</h3>
	<p> Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments. Business history deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Environmental history</h3>
	<p> Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> World history</h3>
	<p> World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States, Japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.</p>
	<p> It has led to highly controversial interpretations by Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, among others.</p>
	<p> The World History Association publishes the Journal of World History every quarter since 1990. The H-World discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> People's history</h3>
	<p> A people's history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the History Workshop movement in Britain in the 1960s.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Intellectual history</h3>
	<p> Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Gender history</h3>
	<p> Gender history is a sub-field of History and Gender studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of women's history. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Public history</h3>
	<p> Public history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Historians</h4>
	<p> Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In lists of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> The judgement of history</h4>
	<p> Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history." The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final. A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Pseudohistory</h4>
	<p> Pseudohistory is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions. Closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Teaching history</h4>
	<h3> Scholarship vs teaching</h3>
	<p> A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where Thomas Frederick Tout was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.</p>
	<p> In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Nationalism</h3>
	<p> From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.</p>
	<p> At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.</p>
	<p> The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Bias in school teaching</h3>
	<p> In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.</p>
	<p> In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained. It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.</p>
	<p> Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.</p>
	<p> In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace." The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Japan. A great country in the easternmost part of Asia. It is a composite of a number of islands, of which the three principal are those of Honshu [ Niphon ], Kyushu [ Saikokf ], and Shikoku [ Sikokf ]; these three islands are surrounded by a number of other amazing islands; some small, full of barren rocks, others large, rich, and fertile. All of these islands and lands that form Japan were divided in the year 590 AD into seven main regions, which are divided into forty-eight provinces and subdivided into several smaller districts.</p>
		<p> The income of all the islands and provinces that belong to the empire of Japan amounts every year to 3,228 mans and 6,200 kokfs of rice, because in Japan , all income consists of these two measures of rice; one man contains ten thousand kokfs, and one kokf three thousand bales or sacks of rice.</p>
		<p> The weather is extremely variable in this vast region; winter is subject to severe cold and summer to excessive heat. It rains a lot throughout the year and especially in the months of June and July, but without the regularity that one notices in the hotter countries of the East Indies. Thunder and lightning are very frequent. The sea, which surrounds Japan , is extremely stormy and dangerous to navigate through with the large number of rocks, dregs, and reefs that are above and below the water.</p>
		<p> The land is generally mountainous, stony, and barren, but the ingenuity and tireless labor of the inhabitants, who also live extremely frugally, made it fertile and able to get by without help from the neighboring countries. The entire nation eats rice, vegetables, and fruit, a restraint that seems a virtue more than a superstition. There is no lack of fresh water as there are a great number of lakes, rivers, and cold, warm, and mineral springs; earthquakes are frequent there and sometimes destroy entire towns with their long and violent shaking.</p>
		<p> The greatest source of Japan ’s wealth consists of all sorts of minerals and metals, particularly exquisite in gold, silver, and copper. There are a number of sulfur mines, among others, an entire island that is only sulfur. The province of Bungo produces pewter so fine and so white that it is almost as valuable as silver. Iron is also found in abundance; other provinces supply precious stones, jasper, agate, red agate, and pearls in oysters and in several other shellfish. Gray amber is gathered on the coasts and everyone can collect it there. The shellfish, to which the inhabitants do not attach much importance, are on par with the beauty of those of Ambon and the Moluccas Islands. Japan also possesses respected drugs which are used for Dye and Medicine. Antimony and ammonia have not yet been discovered there. Quicksilver and borax were brought there by the Chinese.</p>
		<p> The empire of Japan is located between 31 and 42 degrees north latitude . The Jesuits, in a map corrected by their astronomical observations, place it between 157 and 175 degrees 30’ longitude . It extends to the northeast and to the east–northeast; its width is very irregular and narrow compared to its length, which taken in a straight line, and without including all the coasts, is at least 200 miles longer than Germany. It is like the kingdom of Great Britain, chopped and cut, but in a higher degree, by capes, sounds, coves and bays. There is a sound between the northernmost coasts of Japan and a neighboring continent; this is a fact confirmed by the recent discoveries of the Russians; Edo [ Jedo ] is today the capital of the empire; it was in the past Kyoto [ Méaco ]. See Edo and Kyoto.</p>
		<p> If Japan brings out the curiosity of Geographers, it is yet more worthy of attention by a philosopher. We direct the reader’s eyes to the interesting tableau that was made by a philosophy historian of our time. He faithfully painted for us this amazing people, the only ones in Asia never conquered, who appeared invincible, who are not, like so many others, a mixture of different nations, but who seem aboriginal, and even if they descend from the ancient Tartars, 1200 years before Christ according to the opinion of P. Couplet, it is still always certain that they bear no resemblance to neighboring peoples. They have something of England, in the insular pride which is common in them and in the suicide that is believed to be so frequent in the two extremities of our hemisphere, but its government does not resemble the happy government of Great Britain; it bears no comparison to that of the Germans; its system has not flourished in their soil.</p>
		<p> We should have known this country since the XVIIIth century, from the story of the famous Marco Polo. This illustrious Venetian had traveled overland to China and having served for a long time under one of the sons of Genghis Kahn, he had the first knowledge of the islands that we call Japan and that he calls Zipangu ; but his contemporaries who accepted the coarsest fables did not believe the truths that Marco Paulo announced: his manuscript remained in obscurity for a long time. It finally fell into the hands of Christopher Columbus and helped more than a bit to firm up his hope of finding a new world that could join the east and the west. Columbus was mistaken only in the opinion that Japan touched the hemisphere that he discovered; he was so convinced of it that having approached Hispaniola, he believed himself to be in the Zipangu of Marco Polo.</p>
		<p> However, while he added a new world to the Spanish monarchy, the Portuguese for their part expanded with the same joy in the East Indies. The discovery of Japan is due to them and it was the result of a shipwreck. In 1542, when Martin Alphonse de Souza was Viceroy of the East Indies, three Portuguese, Antoine de Mota, François Zemoto, and Antoine Peixota, whose names are worthy of posterity, were thrown by a storm onto the coast of Japan ; they were aboard a junk, loaded with animal hides, which was going from Siam to China: and thus the first knowledge of Japan was spread throughout Europe.</p>
		<p> The government of Japan was for two thousand four hundred years fairly similar to that of the Muslim caliphate and of modern Rome. The leaders of the religion were, in Japan , the leaders of the empire longer than any other nation in the world. The succession of their king pontiffs and their queen pontiffs (because in this country the women were not excluded from the pontifical throne) go back 660 years before our common era.</p>
		<p> But with the secular princes having made themselves imperceptibly sovereign and independent in the provinces, which the ecclesiastic emperor had given them to rule, fortune favored out of the entire empire one courageous man of consummate ability who, from a low and menial condition, became one of the most powerful monarchs in the whole world; he was called Taïco.</p>
		<p> Upon acceding to the throne, he destroyed neither the name nor the race of pontiffs, whose power he usurped, but at the time the ecclesiastic emperor, named Dairi or Dairo , was no more than a revered idol, with the prerogative of a magnificent court; see Dairo. What the Turks did in Baghdad, what the Germans wanted to do in Rome, Taïco did in Japan , and his successors reinforced it.</p>
		<p> It was toward the end of the XVIth century, around the year 1583 AD that this revolution arrived. Taïco, informed of the state of the empire and of the ambitious plans of the princes and the leaders, who had for such a long time taken up arms against one another, found the secret to humble and tame them. They are today so dependent on the Kubo, that’s to say, the secular emperor, that he can disgrace them, exile them, deprive them of their possessions, and put them to death whenever it pleases him, without answering to anyone. He does not allow them to live more than six months on their hereditary estates; they must spend the other six months in the capital, where their wives and children are kept in order to guarantee their loyalty. The largest lands of the crown are governed by lieutenants and by the tax collectors. All the revenues of these lands must go into the coffers of the empire. It seems that several ministers in Europe learned from the great Taïco.</p>
		<p> This prince, in order to protect his authority from the fury of the people, whose civil wars were coming to an end, created a new body of laws, so strict that they did not seem to be written like those of Draco, with ink, but with blood. They spoke only of bodily punishment, or of punishment by death, without hope of pardon, or of stays for any violations of the emperor’s ordinances. It is true, says M. de Montesquieu, that the astonishing character of this opinionated, capricious, determined, and bizarre people who brave all dangers and all misfortunes, seems at first sight, to absolve this legislator of the atrocity of his laws; but people who naturally scorn death and who cut their stomachs open at the slightest whim, are they tempered or stopped by the sight of torture and can they not get used to it?</p>
		<p> At the same time that the emperor, about whom I speak, tried by atrocious laws to provide peace to the state, he changed nothing in the diverse religions established from time immemorial in the country and allowed all his subjects the freedom to think as they wished on this matter.</p>
		<p> Among these religions, the one that is the most widespread in Japan subscribes to the idea of rewards and punishments in the afterlife and even that of Sinto, which has so many sectarians, recognizes heavenly places for the good, while not subscribing to the idea of hellish places for the bad; but these two sects agree on morality. Their principal commandments, which they call divines , are the same as ours; lying, loquacity, larceny, murder are prohibited; it is natural law reduced to its positive precepts. They add to that the precept of temperance, which prohibits strong liquor, of whatever kind, and they extend the prohibition against murder to animals; Siaka, who gave them this law, lived about one thousand years before our common era. They differ from us in morality then only in the precept of sparing beasts and this difference is not to their discredit. It is true that they have many fables in their religion, in which they resemble many peoples and us in particular, who knew only crude fables before Christianity.</p>
		<p> Human nature established other resemblances between these peoples and us. They have the superstition of spells which we had for so long. One finds in their culture the pilgrimages, the tests of fire, which were in the past a part of our legal system; finally they place their great men in the sky, like the Greeks and Romans. Their pontiff (if we can call him that) has, like that of modern Rome, the sole right to make apotheoses and to consecrate temples to men whom he judges worthy of them. They have also had for a long time monks, hermits, even institutes, which are not much different from our military orders; for they have an ancient society of monks, who take a vow to defend religion.</p>
		<p> Japan is also divided among several sects under a king pontiff, as it is under a secular emperor; but all the sects are in agreement on the same moral points. Those who believe in metempsychosis and those who do not believe in it, abstained and abstain still today from eating the flesh of animals which help man; all agree to let them live and to regard murder as an act of ingratitude and cruelty. The law of Moses kill and eat is not in their principles and probably Christianity adopted those of this people, when it developed in Japan .</p>
		<p> Confucian doctrine made much progress in this empire; as it can all be reduced to simple morality, it charmed all the minds of those who are not followers of the monks and it is still the right-minded part of the nation. It is believed that the progress of this philosophy did not contribute much to ruining the power of Dairi: the emperor who reigned in 1700 did not have any other religion.</p>
		<p> It seems that this doctrine of Confucius is exploited more in Japan than in China. The Japanese philosophers regard suicide as a virtuous act, when it does not hurt society; the natural and violent pride of these islanders often puts this theory into practice and makes homicide a lot more common in Japan than it is in England.</p>
		<p> Freedom of conscience having always been granted in this empire, as well as in almost all the rest of the Orient, several foreign religions were peaceably introduced in Japan . God thus permitted that the way be opened to the Gospel in these vast countries; no one denies that it made prodigious progress at the end of the seventeenth century, in half of this empire. The famous delegation of three Christian Japanese princes to Pope Gregory XIII is, it seems to me, the most flattering homage that the Holy See ever received. The entire country, where today one must renounce the Gospel and from which no subject can leave, was on the point of being a Christian kingdom and perhaps a Portuguese kingdom. Our priests were honored there more than here; at present their head has a price there and this price is even quite considerable: it is around twelve thousand livres.</p>
		<p> The indiscretion of a Portuguese priest, who refused to give way to one of the officers of the emperor, was the first cause of this revolution. The second was the obstinacy of some Jesuits, who defended their rights too much, in not wanting to give up a house that a Japanese lord had given to them, and whom the son of this lord demanded back from them. The third was the worry of being subjugated by the Christians. The monks feared being deprived of their ancient possessions and the emperor finally feared for the state. The Spanish made themselves masters of the Philippines, neighbors of Japan ; we know what they had done in America so it’s not surprising that the Japanese were alarmed.</p>
		<p> The secular emperor of Japan thus banned the Christian religion in 1586; the practice was prohibited to his subjects under penalty of death; but as commerce with the Portuguese and the Spanish was still permitted, their missionaries made many proselytes among the people, who were sentenced to torture. The monarch prohibited all inhabitants from allowing any Christian preacher into the country; despite this prohibition, the governor of the Philippine islands let a delegation of Cordeliers go to the emperor of Japan . These ambassadors began to build a public chapel in the capital city; they were chased out and persecution intensified. There was for a long time alternating cruelty and leniency. Finally the famous rebellion of the Christians occurred, which took place by force and with weapons in 1637, in a town of the empire; thus they were hounded, attacked, and massacred in numbers totaling thirty-seven thousand in the following year of 1638, under the reign of the empress Mikaddo. This awful massacre stopped the revolt and abolished the Christian religion entirely from Japan , which had been introduced in the year 1549.</p>
		<p> If the Portuguese and the Spanish had contented themselves with the tolerance that they enjoyed, they would have been as untroubled in this empire as the dozens of sects established in Méaco, and which composed together, in this sole town, more than four hundred thousand souls.</p>
		<p> Never was commerce more advantageous to the Portuguese than that with Japan . It’s clear enough, from the care that the Dutch have taken to preserve it, to the exclusion of other peoples, that this commerce produced, especially in the beginning, immense profits. The Portuguese purchased the best tea in Asia there, the most beautiful porcelain, those painted, lacquered, and varnished woods like screens, tables, trunks, boxes, tray-top tables, and other similar items which every day diminish the value of our luxury goods; copper of a superior quality to ours; finally silver and gold, the main object of all the trading industries.</p>
		<p> Japan , as populated as China proportionally, and no less industrious, while the nation is prouder and braver there, possesses almost everything that we have and almost everything that we lack. The peoples of the Orient were once much superior to our western peoples, in all the manual and spiritual arts. But how we have made up for lost time, says M. de Voltaire! The countries where Bramante and Michelangelo built Saint Peter’s of Rome, where Raphael painted, or Newton calculated infinity, or Leibnitz shared this glory, or Huyggens applied the cycloid to the pendulum clock, where Jean de Bruges discovered oil painting, where Cinna and Athalie have been written; these countries, I say, became the first countries of the world. The eastern peoples are now in fine art only barbarians or children, despite their antiquity and all that nature did for them</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Japan (Japanese: 日本 Nippon  or Nihon ; formally 日本国 About this sound Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku, meaning "State of Japan") is a sovereign island nation in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland, and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest.</p>
		<p> The kanji that make up Japan's name mean "sun origin". 日 can be read as ni and means sun, while 本 can be read as hon, or pon and means origin. Japan is often referred to by the famous epithet "Land of the Rising Sun" in reference to its Japanese name.</p>
		<p> Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area and often are referred to as home islands. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions; Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and Okinawa being the southernmost one. The population of 127 million is the world's tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan's total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the city of Tokyo, the capital of Japan.</p>
		<p> Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor.</p>
		<p> Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma, and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism.</p>
		<p> The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3, 1947 during the occupation by the SCAP, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.</p>
		<p> Japan is a member of the UN, the OECD, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power. The country has the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world, with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.</p>
		<p> Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth-largest military budget, used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index. Its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world.</p>
		<p> Etymology</p>
		<p> Main article: Names of Japan</p>
		<p> The Japanese word for Japan is 日本, which is pronounced Nihon or Nippon, and literally means "the origin of the sun". The character nichi (日) means "sun" or "day"; hon (本) means "base" or "origin". The compound therefore means "origin of the sun", and is the source of the popular Western epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".</p>
		<p> The earliest record of the name "Nihon" appears in the Chinese historical records of the Tang dynasty, the Old Book of Tang. At the end of the seventh century, a delegation from Japan requested that Nihon be used as the name of their country. This name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the Sui dynasty. Prince Shōtoku, the Regent of Japan, sent a mission to China with a letter in which he called himself 'the Emperor of the Land where the Sun rises' (日出處天子). The message said: "Here I the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets. How are you." Prior to the adoption of Nihon, other terms such as "Yamato" (大和?, or Great Wa) and "Wakoku" (倭国?) were used. The term Wa (和?) is a homophone of Wo 倭 (pronounced Wa by the Japanese) used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century Three Kingdoms period. However, the Japanese dislike the connotation of Wa 倭 with the word 'dwarf' and it was therefore replaced with the Wa (和?), meaning "harmony".</p>
		<p> The English word Japan possibly derives from the historical Chinese pronunciation of 日本. The Old Mandarin or possibly early Wu Chinese pronunciation of Japan was recorded by Marco Polo as Cipangu. In modern Shanghainese, a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters 日本 Japan is Zeppen . The old Malay word for Japan, Japun or Japang, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably Fukienese or Ningpo, and this Malay word was encountered by Portuguese traders in South East Asia in the 16th century. These Early Portuguese traders then brought the word to Europe. The first record of this name in English is in a book published in 1577 and spelled Giapan, in a translation of a 1565 letter written by a Portuguese Jesuit Luís Fróis.</p>
		<p> From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was Dai Nippon Teikoku (大日本帝國), meaning "the Empire of Great Japan". Today, the name Nihon-koku / Nippon-koku (日本国) is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the meaning of "the State of Japan"; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku (国), meaning "country", "nation" or "state".</p>
		<p> History</p>
		<p> Prehistory and ancient history</p>
		<p> A Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people, characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.</p>
		<p> Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).</p>
		<p> The Nara period (710–784) of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and architecture. The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō before relocating it to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794.</p>
		<p> This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem "Kimigayo" were written during this time.</p>
		<p> Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, Tendai by Saichō, and Shingon by Kūkai. Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo-shū, Jōdo Shinshū) became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century.</p>
		<p> Feudal era</p>
		<p> Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, and he established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.</p>
		<p> Ashikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, Kyoto. This was the start of the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The Ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of Miyabi) prospered. This evolved to Higashiyama Culture, and prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyōs), and a civil war (the Ōnin War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period ("Warring States").</p>
		<p> During the 16th century, traders and Jesuit missionaries from Portugal reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. This allowed Oda Nobunaga to obtain European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyōs. His consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603). After he was assassinated in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.</p>
		<p> Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603, and he established the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo (modern Tokyo). The Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyōs; and in 1639, the isolationist sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868). The study of Western sciences, known as rangaku, continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku ("national studies"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.</p>
		<p> Modern era</p>
		<p> On March 31, 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the "Black Ships" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the Emperor (the Meiji Restoration).</p>
		<p> Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of Sakhalin. Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.</p>
		<p> World War I enabled Japan, on the side of the victorious Allies, to widen its influence and territorial holdings in Asia. The early 20th century saw a brief period of "Taishō democracy (1912–1926)" but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism, the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups. The subsequent "Shōwa period" initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about Japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology. In 1931 Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation, Japan resigned from the League of Nations in 1933. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, and the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers. In 1941, following its defeat in the brief Soviet–Japanese Border War, Japan negotiated the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, which lasted until 1945 with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.</p>
		<p> The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). The Imperial Japanese Army swiftly captured the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking Massacre. In 1940, the Empire then invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, bringing the US and the UK into World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories across the Pacific during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15. The war cost Japan, its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the US) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East on May 3, 1946 to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes. However, the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers despite calls for the trial of both groups.</p>
		<p> In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession. In the beginning of the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.</p>
		<p> Geography</p>
		<p> Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia. The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24° and 46°N, and longitudes 122° and 146°E. The main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.</p>
		<p> About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</p>
		<p> The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.</p>
		<p> Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.</p>
		<p> Climate</p>
		<p> The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.</p>
		<p> In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.</p>
		<p> The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.</p>
		<p> The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 40.9 °C (105.6 °F) was recorded on August 16, 2007. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.</p>
		<p> Biodiversity</p>
		<p> Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the Large Japanese Field Mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.</p>
		<p> Environment</p>
		<p> Main article: Environmental issues in Japan</p>
		<p> In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.</p>
		<p> As of June 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan. The NGO Climate Action Network announced Japan as the winner of its "Fossil of the Day" award for "doing the most to block progress on climate action."</p>
		<p> Japan ranks 39th in the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference that created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.</p>
		<p> Politics</p>
		<p> Main article: Politics of Japan</p>
		<p> Government</p>
		<p> Japan is a constitutional monarchy whereby the power of the Emperor is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the constitution to be "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people." Power is held chiefly by the Prime Minister and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Akihito is the current Emperor of Japan; Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, stands as next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.</p>
		<p> Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, seated in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The Diet is a bicameral body, consisting of a lower house, the House of Representatives with 475 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper house, the House of Councillors with 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet is dominated by the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan (DP) and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral success since 1955, except for a brief 11-month period between 1993 and 1994, and from 2009 to 2012. As of May 2017, it holds 294 seats in the lower house and 121 seats in the upper house.</p>
		<p> The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the Ministers of State. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Shinzō Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the Prime Minister on December 26, 2012 and became the country's sixth prime minister to be sworn in during a span of six years. Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet.</p>
		<p> Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. The Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet; however, without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.</p>
		<p> Administrative divisions</p>
		<p> Further information: Administrative divisions of Japan</p>
		<p> See also: Prefectures of Japan</p>
		<p> Japan consists of 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. The nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities, towns and villages with each other. This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.</p>
		<p> Foreign relations</p>
		<p> Japan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the UN since December 1956. Japan is a member of the G8, APEC, and "ASEAN Plus Three", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.</p>
		<p> Japan has close ties to the United States. Since Japan's defeat by the United States in World War II, the two countries have maintained close economic and defense relations. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan for that purpose.</p>
		<p> Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands (including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group) which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's assertions concerning Liancourt Rocks (Japanese: "Takeshima", Korean: "Dokdo") are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan. Japan has strained relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands; and with the People's Republic of China over the status of Okinotorishima.</p>
		<p> Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. However, in December 2015, Japan and South Korea agreed to settle the issue with Japan issuing a formal apology and taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women.</p>
		<p> Military</p>
		<p> Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index. The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>
		<p> The 21st century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with globalization. The security environment around Japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by North Korea. Transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance. Japan, including its Self Defense Forces, has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security, such as UN peacekeeping operations. Building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state, the Government of Japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include: the establishment of the National Security Council (NSC), the adoption of the National Security Strategy (NSS), and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG). These efforts are made based on the belief that Japan, as a "Proactive Contributor to Peace", needs to contribute more actively to the peace and stability of the region and the international community, while coordinating with other countries including its ally, the United States.</p>
		<p> Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy. A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.</p>
		<p> In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. He said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.</p>
		<p> Economy</p>
		<p> Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2014, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.</p>
		<p> Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China. As of 2010, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Some 20 million people, around 17 per cent of the population, were below the poverty line in 2007. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.</p>
		<p> Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. As of 2012, Japan's main export markets were China (18.1 percent), the United States (17.8 percent), South Korea (7.7 percent), Thailand (5.5 percent) and Hong Kong (5.1 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2012 were China (21.3 percent), the US (8.8 percent), Australia (6.4 percent), Saudi Arabia (6.2 percent), United Arab Emirates (5.0 percent), South Korea (4.6 percent) and Qatar (4.0 percent).</p>
		<p> Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country. Junichirō Koizumi's administration began some pro-competition reforms, and foreign investment in Japan has soared.</p>
		<p> Japan ranks 27th of 189 countries in the 2014 Ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like "The Toyota Way", and shareholder activism is rare.</p>
		<p> Economic history</p>
		<p> Modern Japan's economic growth began in the Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy. Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia. The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
		<p> Growth slowed in the 1990s during the "Lost Decade" due to after-effects of the Japanese asset price bubble and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000. The economy recovered after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period.</p>
		<p> Today Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015–2016.</p>
		<p> Agriculture and fishery</p>
		<p> The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres (14,000,000 acres) cultivated.</p>
		<p> Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.</p>
		<p> Rice accounts for almost all of Japan's cereal production. Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.</p>
		<p> In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.</p>
		<p> Today, Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.</p>
		<p> Industry</p>
		<p> Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. Japan's major industries are motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, metals, ships, chemicals and processed foods; some major Japanese industrial companies include Toyota, Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel.</p>
		<p> Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company. The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong thanks to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.</p>
		<p> Services</p>
		<p> Main article: Trade and services in Japan</p>
		<p> Japan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, ÆON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines listed as some of the largest in the world. Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. Japan Post, one of the country's largest providers of savings and insurance services, was slated for privatization by 2015. The six major keiretsus are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.</p>
		<p> Tourism</p>
		<p> Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015  and increased by 21.8% to attracted 24.03 million international tourists in 2016. Tourism from abroad is one of the few promising businesses in Japan. Foreign visitors to Japan doubled in last decade and reached 10 million people for the first time in 2013, led by increase of Asian visitors.</p>
		<p> In 2008, the Japanese government has set up Japan Tourism Agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020. In 2016, having met the 20 million target, the government has revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030.</p>
		<p> Japan has 20 World Heritage Sites, including Himeji Castle, Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto and Nara. Popular tourist attractions include Tokyo and Hiroshima, Mount Fuji, ski resorts such as Niseko in Hokkaido, Okinawa, riding the shinkansen and taking advantage of Japan's hotel and hotspring network.</p>
		<p> For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015. In 2009, the Yomiuri Shimbun published a modern list of famous sights under the name Heisei Hyakkei (the Hundred Views of the Heisei period). The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranks Japan 4th out of 141 countries overall, which was the best in Asia. Japan gained relatively high scores in almost all aspects, especially health and hygiene, safety and security, cultural resources and business travel.</p>
		<p> In 2016, 24,039,053 foreign tourists visited Japan. Neighbouring South Korea is Japan's most important source of foreign tourists. In 2010, the 2.4 million arrivals made up 27% of the tourists visiting Japan. Chinese travelers are the highest spenders in Japan by country, spending an estimated 196.4 billion yen (US$2.4 billion) in 2011, or almost a quarter of total expenditure by foreign visitors, according to data from the Japan Tourism Agency.</p>
		<p> The Japanese government hopes to receive 40 million foreign tourists every year by 2020.</p>
		<p> Science and technology</p>
		<p> Main article: Science and technology in Japan</p>
		<p> Japan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in fields related to the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget. The amount spent on research and development relative to its gross domestic product third highest in the world. The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, and three Fields medalists.</p>
		<p> Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots as of 2013—though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees.</p>
		<p> Electronics and automotive engineering</p>
		<p> The Japanese electronics and automotive manufacturing industry is well known throughout the world, and the country's electronic and automotive products account for a large share in the global market, compared to a majority of other countries. Brands such as Fujifilm, Sony, Nintendo, Panasonic, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are internationally famous. It's estimated that 16% of the world's gold and 22% of the world's silver is contained in electronic technology in Japan.</p>
		<p> Japan has started a project to build the world's fastest supercomputer by the end of 2017.</p>
		<p> Aerospace</p>
		<p> The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. Japan's plans in space exploration include: launching a space probe to Venus, Akatsuki; developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2016; and building a moon base by 2030.</p>
		<p> On September 14, 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE is also known as Kaguya, after the lunar princess of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. Kaguya is the largest lunar mission since the Apollo program. Its purpose is to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, flying at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi). The probe's mission was ended when it was deliberately crashed by JAXA into the Moon on June 11, 2009.</p>
		<p> Nobel laureates</p>
		<p> Main article: List of Japanese Nobel laureates</p>
		<p> Japan has received the most science Nobel prizes in Asia and ranked 8th in the world. Japanese researchers have won several Nobel prizes. Hideki Yukawa, educated at Kyoto University, was awarded the prize for physics in 1949. Sin-Itiro Tomonaga followed in 1965. Solid-state physicist Leo Esaki, educated at the University of Tokyo, received the prize in 1973. Kenichi Fukui of Kyoto University shared the 1981 chemistry prize, and Susumu Tonegawa, also educated at Kyoto University, became Japan's first (and, as of 2007, only) laureate in physiology or medicine in 1987. Japanese chemists took prizes in 2000 and 2001: first Hideki Shirakawa (Tokyo Institute of Technology) and then Ryōji Noyori (Kyoto University). Masatoshi Koshiba (University of Tokyo) and Koichi Tanaka (Tohoku University) won in physics and chemistry, respectively, in 2002. Makoto Kobayashi, Toshihide Masukawa, and Yoichiro Nambu who is an American citizen when awarded, shared the physics prize and Osamu Shimomura also won the chemistry prize in 2008. Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, Shuji Nakamura, who is an American citizen when awarded, shared the physics prize in 2014, and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi in 2016.</p>
		<p> Infrastructure</p>
		<p> Transportation</p>
		<p> Japan's road spending has been extensive. Its 1.2 million kilometres (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation. As of April 2012 Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometres (134,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometres (14,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometres (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometres (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometres (5,000 miles) of national expressways. The Foreign Press Center/Japan cites a total length of expressways at 7,641 kilometres (4,748 miles) (fiscal 2008). A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. Hokkaido has a separate network, and Okinawa Island has a highway of this type. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises. New and used cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.</p>
		<p> Since privatisation in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality. Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.</p>
		<p> There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Chūbu Centrair International Airport. Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.</p>
		<p> Energy</p>
		<p> As of 2011, 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power, and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011, down from 24.9 percent the previous year. However, by May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service. As of November 2014, two reactors at Sendai are likely to restart in early 2015. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.</p>
		<p> Water supply and sanitation</p>
		<p> The government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.</p>
		<p> Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.</p>
		<p> Access to improved sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10 mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, well below the national effluent standard of 20 mg/l.</p>
		<p> Water supply and sanitation in Japan is facing some challenges, such as a decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.</p>
		<p> Demographics</p>
		<p> Main articles: Demographics of Japan, Japanese people, and Ethnic issues in Japan</p>
		<p> Population</p>
		<p> Japan's population is estimated at around 127 million, with 80% of the population living on Honshū. Japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan. In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents stationed throughout the country) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians (said to be primarily Japanese descendants, or nikkeijin, along with their spouses), the largest community of Westerners.</p>
		<p> The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan peoples, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin. There are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara Archipelago. In 2014, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.5% of the total population. Japan is widely regarded as ethnically homogeneous, and does not compile ethnicity or race statistics for Japanese nationals; however, at least one analysis describes Japan as a multiethnic society. Most Japanese continue to see Japan as a monocultural society. Former Japanese Prime Minister and current Finance Minister Tarō Asō described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture", which drew criticism from representatives of ethnic minorities such as the Ainu.</p>
		<p> Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010–2015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post–World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.</p>
		<p> Religion</p>
		<p> Japan has full religious freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.</p>
		<p> Shinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys. This is due to the fact that "Shinto" has different meanings in Japan: most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to Shinto organisations, and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk "Shinto", "Shinto membership" is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects. Shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country. Buddhism first arrived in Japan in the 6th century; it was introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea.</p>
		<p> Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians. Most of them living in the western part of the country, where the missionaries' activities were greatest during the 16th century. Nagasaki Prefecture has the highest percentage of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996. As of 2007 there are 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.</p>
		<p> Islam in Japan is estimated to constitute, about 80–90%, of foreign born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Much of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.</p>
		<p> Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, and Judaism, and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.</p>
		<p> Languages</p>
		<p> Main articles: Languages of Japan and Japanese language</p>
		<p> More than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.</p>
		<p> Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.</p>
		<p> Problems</p>
		<p> The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled. This decline was made worse by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 2,600 still listed as missing as of 2014.</p>
		<p> Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the US took in 76,000.</p>
		<p> Japan suffers from a high suicide rate. In 2009, the number of suicides exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year. Suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30.</p>
		<p> Education</p>
		<p> Primary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and middle school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.</p>
		<p> Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.</p>
		<p> Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>
		<p> The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Created 16 Nobel Prize laureates. The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world.</p>
		<p> Health</p>
		<p> Main articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan</p>
		<p> In Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.</p>
		<p> Culture</p>
		<p> Japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Nineteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen of which are of cultural significance.</p>
		<p> Architecture</p>
		<p> Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.</p>
		<p> The introduction of Buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.</p>
		<p> During the Meiji Restoration of 1868 the history of Japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events. The first was the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, which formally separated Buddhism from Shinto and Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines, breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years.</p>
		<p> Second, it was then that Japan underwent a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.</p>

		<p> Further information: Japanese art, Japanese garden, and Japanese aesthetics</p>
		<p> The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.</p>
		<p> The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai coined the term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.</p>
		<p> Music</p>
		<p> Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied recitative of the Noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, from the sixteenth. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers.</p>
		<p> Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.</p>
		<p> Literature</p>
		<p> The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.</p>
		<p> During the Edo period, the chōnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were the first "modern" novelists of Japan, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors—Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).</p>
		<p> Philosophy</p>
		<p> Japanese Philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign; particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago.</p>
		<p> Archaeological evidence and early historical accounts suggest that Japan was originally an animistic culture, which viewed the world as infused with kami (神) or sacred presence as taught by Shinto, though it is not a philosophy as such, but has greatly influenced all other philosophies in their Japanese interpretations.</p>
		<p> Confucianism entered Japan from China around the 5th century A.D., as did Buddhism. Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.</p>
		<p> Neo-Confucianism, which became prominent in the sixteenth century during the Tokugawa era, shaped Japanese ideas of virtue and social responsibility, and, through its emphasis on investigating the principle or configuration of things, stimulated the Japanese study of the natural world. Also since the 16th century, certain indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour have been held. Western philosophy has had its major impact in Japan only since the middle of the 19th century.</p>
		<p> Cuisine</p>
		<p> Japanese cuisine is based on combining staple foods, typically Japanese rice or noodles, with a soup and okazu—dishes made from fish, vegetable, tofu and the like—to add flavor to the staple food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The phrase ichijū-sansai (一汁三菜?, "one soup, three sides") refers to the makeup of a typical meal served, but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and yūsoku cuisine. The term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays.</p>
		<p> Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream, a very popular flavor. Almost all manufacturers produce a version of it. Kakigori is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk. It is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals. Popular Japanese beverages such as sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that, typically, contains 15%~17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Other beverage like beer is produced in some region such as Sapporo Brewery, the oldest Japan beer's brand. The Michelin Guide has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.</p>
		<p> Holidays</p>
		<p> Officially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated under the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律 Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. In 2006, the country decided to add Shōwa Day, a new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move Greenery Day to May 4. These changes took effect in 2007. In 2014, the House of Councillors decided to add Mountain Day (山の日? Yama no Hi) to the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine Club. It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan's mountains.</p>
		<p> The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, Labour Thanksgiving Day on November 23, and The Emperor's Birthday on December 23.</p>
		<p> Festivals</p>
		<p> There are many festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese as matsuri (祭) which celebrate annually. There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon. Festivals are often based around one event, with food stalls, entertainment, and carnival games to keep people entertained. Its usually sponsored by a local shrine or temple, though they can be secular.</p>
		<p> Notable festival often feature processions which may include elaborate floats. Preparation for these processions is usually organised at the level of neighborhoods, or machi (町). Prior to these, the local kami may be ritually installed in mikoshi and paraded through the streets, such as Gion in Kyoto, and Hadaka in Okayama.</p>
		<p> Sports</p>
		<p> Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the education system.</p>
		<p> Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. Further, the country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record 6 times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan will host the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.</p>
		<p> Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times. Also, Japan recently won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan, as are forms of auto racing like the Super GT series and Formula Nippon. The country has produced one NBA player, Yuta Tabuse.</p>
		<p> Media</p>
		<p> Television and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take apart. For a long time, newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in Japan, although audience attitudes towards television changed with the emergence of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Over the last decade, television has clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.</p>
		<p> There are 6 nationwide television networks, such as NHK (public broadcasting), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi, and TV Tokyo Network (TXN). For the most part, television networks were established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television show. According to the fourth NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 95 percent of Japanese watch television every day. The average daily duration of television viewing ranged from approximately four hours.</p>
		<p> Japanese readers have a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers with a total of 50 million copies of 'set paper' with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspaper's publishers are Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun, and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in June 1999, 85.4 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women read a newspaper every day. Average daily reading times vary with 27.7 minutes on weekdays and 31.7 minutes on holidays and Sunday.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Jew, follower of the Jewish religion.</p>
		<p> This religion, the author of the Persian Letters [Montesquieu] says, is an old trunk that has produced two branches, Christianity and Islam, which have covered the earth; or rather, he adds, she is a mother of two girls who have crushed her with a thousand plagues. But whatever bad treatment she has received from them, she never ceases to glory in having given birth to them. By means of both of them she embraces the world, while her venerable age embraces all times.</p>
		<p> Josephus, Basnage and Prideaux have exhaustively studied the history of the people who have remained so constantly devoted to this old religion, and who so clearly stamp the infancy, maturity and the progress of our own. So as not to bore the reader with details he will find in so many books about the people under consideration here, we shall limit ourselves to less well-known remarks about their number, their dispersion everywhere in the world, and their inviolable attachment to Mosaic law in the midst of opprobrium and vexations.</p>
		<p> When one considers the horrors that the Jews have experienced since J[esus] C[hrist], the carnage that they suffered under certain Roman emperors, and the slaughters that were repeated against them so many times in all the Christian states, one is astonished that this people still survives; yet not only does it survive, but according to appearances it is no less numerous today than it was long ago in the land of Canaan. One will not doubt this if, after calculating the number of Jews who are scattered in the West, one adds the prodigious multitudes who swarm in the Orient, in China, among most of the nations of Europe and Africa, in the East and West Indies, and even in the interior of America.</p>
		<p> Their firm attachment to the law of Moses is no less remarkable, especially when one considers the frequent apostasies they committed under the government of their kings, their judges and the view of their temples. Judaism is now, of all the world's religions, the one that is most rarely abjured; and this is in part the fruit of the persecutions that it has suffered. Its adherents, perpetual martyrs to their belief, have regarded themselves more and more as the source of all sanctity, and have only viewed us as rebellious Jews who have changed the law of God while punishing those who have held fast to it.</p>
		<p> Their population must naturally be attributed to their exemption from military service, their ardor for marriage, their custom of contracting for it early in their families, their divorce law, their sober and regulated lifestyle, their abstinence, work and exercise.</p>
		<p> Their dispersion is no less easy to understand. If, while Jerusalem subsisted along with its temple, the Jews were sometimes expelled from their fatherland by the vicissitudes of Empires, they have been even more frequently expelled by a blind zeal from all the countries in which they have lived since the progress of Christianity and Islam. Reduced to running from land to land, from sea to sea, to earn their living, everywhere declared incapable of possessing any real estate and of having any employment, they have seen themselves forced to disperse from place to place, and to be prevented from establishing themselves permanently in any country, as they lack support, strength for maintaining [support], and education in the military arts.</p>
		<p> This dispersion would not have failed to ruin the religion of any other nation; but that of the Jews has been sustained by nature and by the strength of its laws. These require them to live together as much as possible in the same body, or at least in the same place, to avoid friendships with outsiders, to marry among themselves, and only to eat the flesh of animals whose blood they have shed or prepared according to their manner. These ordinances, and other similar ones, tie them most tightly together, fortify them in their belief, separate them from other human beings, and leave them for their subsistence only commerce, a profession long disdained by the majority of the peoples of Europe.</p>
		<p> It is for this reason that this profession was left to them during the centuries of barbarism; and as they necessarily enriched themselves through it, they were called infamous usurers. Kings who could not go through the pockets of their subjects tortured the Jews , whom they did not regard as citizens. What happened to them in England can give an idea of what was done to them in other countries. When King John needed money, he had the rich Jews of his kingdom imprisoned in order to extort money from their hands; there were few who escaped prosecution in his chamber of justice. One of them, from whom seven teeth were torn out one after the other in order to get at his money, gave a thousand silver marks at number eight. Henry III drew from Aaron, a Jew of York, 14 thousand silver marks and ten million for the queen. He sold the other Jews of his country to his brother Richard for a certain number of years, ut quos rex excoriaverat, comes evisceraret, ["so the count could eviscerate those whom the king excoriated"], says Mathieu Paris.</p>
		<p> In France one did not neglect to employ the same treatment against the Jews . They were put in prison, pillaged, sold, accused of sorcery, of sacrificing children, of poisoning the fountains; they were chased out of the kingdom, allowed to return when one needed money, and during the period when they were tolerated, they were distinguished from other inhabitants through infamous marks.</p>
		<p> In addition, the custom was introduced in this kingdom of confiscating all the goods of Jews who embraced Christianity. We know of such a bizarre custom by the law that abrogated it; this was the edict of the king given at Basville on April 4, 1392. The true reason for this confiscation, which the author of the Spirit of the Laws [Montesquieu] has so well explained, was a kind of right of amortization for the prince, or for the lords, on the taxes, to which they succeeded, that they levied on the Jews as serfs subject to mortmain. Now they were deprived of this benefice when the latter embraced Christianity.</p>
		<p> In a word, one cannot express how this nation has been played with in every place from one century to the other. They had their goods confiscated when they accepted Christianity; and they were burned when they did not want to accept it.</p>
		<p> Finally, ceaselessly proscribed from every country, they ingeniously found the means of saving their fortunes and of assuring their pensions forever. Banned from France under Philip the Long in 1318, they took refuge in Lombardy; there they gave bankers letters drawn on those to whom they had confided their belongings when they left, and these letters were exchanged for cash. The admirable invention of letters of exchange was born of desperation; and only then did commerce become able to elude violence and be conducted by everyone.</p>
		<p> Since that time princes have opened their eyes to their own interests and treated the Jews with greater moderation. They have sensed, in some parts of the north and south, that they could not do without their help. But (without speaking of the Grand Duke of Tuscany) Holland and England, which are animated by the noblest principles, have accorded them every possible mild treatment under the invariable protection of their governments. Thus dispersed in our day with the greatest security they have ever had in every country in Europe where commerce reigns, they have become instruments by means of which the most distant nations can converse and correspond together. They have become like the pegs and nails that one uses in a great building, and which are necessary to join all of its parts. There is regret in Spain for having expelled them, as well as in France for having persecuted subjects whose belief differed in a few points from that of the prince. Love of the Christian religion consists in its practice; and this practice only expresses mildness, humanity, charity.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> The Jews (/dʒuːz/; Hebrew: יְהוּדִים‎ ISO 259-3 Yhudim, Israeli pronunciation), also known as the Jewish people, are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites, or Hebrews, of the Ancient Near East. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.</p>
		<p> Jews originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation and Exile, and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.</p>
		<p> The worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million prior to World War II, but approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust. Since then the population has slowly risen again, and as of 2015 was estimated at 14.3 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank, or less than 0.2% of the total world population (roughly one in every 514 people). According to the report, about 43% of all Jews reside in Israel (6.2 million), and 40% in the United States (5.7 million), with most of the remainder living in Europe (1.4 million) and Canada (0.4 million). These numbers include all those who self-identified as Jews in a socio-demographic study or were identified as such by a respondent in the same household. The exact world Jewish population, however, is difficult to measure. In addition to issues with census methodology, disputes among proponents of halakhic, secular, political, and ancestral identification factors regarding who is a Jew may affect the figure considerably depending on the source. Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population. The modern State of Israel was established as a Jewish state and defines itself as such in its Declaration of Independence and Basic Laws. Its Law of Return grants the right of citizenship to any Jew who requests it.</p>
		<p> Despite their small percentage of the world's population, Jews have significantly influenced and contributed to human progress in many fields, including philosophy, ethics, literature, business, fine arts and architecture, religion, music, theatre and cinema, medicine, as well as science and technology, both historically and in modern times.</p>
		<p> Name and etymology</p>
		<p> Main articles: Jew (word) and Ioudaios</p>
		<p> The English word Jew continues Middle English Gyw, Iewe. These terms derive from Old French giu, earlier juieu, which had elided (dropped) the letter "d" from the Medieval Latin Iudaeus, which, like the New Testament Greek term Ioudaios, meant both Jews and Judeans / "of Judea".</p>
		<p> The Greek term was originally a loan from Aramaic Y'hūdāi, corresponding to Hebrew: יְהוּדִי‎, Yehudi (sg.); יְהוּדִים‎, Yehudim (pl.), in origin the term for a member of the tribe of Judah or the people of the kingdom of Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, the name of both the tribe and kingdom derive from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob.</p>
		<p> The Hebrew word for Jew, יְהוּדִי‎ ISO 259-3 Yhudi, is pronounced , with the stress on the final syllable, in Israeli Hebrew, in its basic form. The Ladino name is ג׳ודיו‎, Djudio (sg.); ג׳ודיוס‎, Djudios (pl.); Yiddish: ייִד‎ Yid (sg.); ייִדן‎, Yidn (pl.).</p>
		<p> The etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g., يَهُودِيّ yahūdī (sg.), al-yahūd (pl.), and بَنُو اِسرَائِيل banū isrāʼīl in Arabic, "Jude" in German, "judeu" in Portuguese, "juif" in French, "jøde" in Danish and Norwegian, "judío" in Spanish, "jood" in Dutch, "żyd" in Polish etc., but derivations of the word "Hebrew" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., in Italian (Ebreo), in Persian ("Ebri/Ebrani" (Persian: عبری/عبرانی‎‎)) and Russian (Еврей, Yevrey). The German word "Jude" is pronounced , the corresponding adjective "jüdisch"  (Jewish) is the origin of the word "Yiddish". (See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview.)</p>
		<p> According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, fourth edition (2000):</p>
		<p> It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.</p>
		<p> Origins</p>
		<p> A factual reconstruction for the origin of the Jews is a difficult and complex endeavor. It requires examining at least 3,000 years of ancient human history using documents in vast quantities and variety written in at least ten near Eastern languages. As archaeological discovery relies upon researchers and scholars from diverse disciplines, the goal is to interpret all of the factual data, focusing on the most consistent theory. In this case, it is complicated by long standing politics and religious and cultural prejudices.</p>
		<p> According to the Hebrew Bible narrative, Jewish ancestry is traced back to the Biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, his son Isaac, Isaac's son Jacob, and the Biblical matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel, who lived in Canaan around the 18th century BCE. Jacob and his family migrated to Ancient Egypt after being invited to live with Jacob's son Joseph by the Pharaoh himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the Exodus led by Moses, traditionally dated to the 13th century BCE, after which the Israelites conquered Canaan.</p>
		<p> Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the Patriarchs and of the Exodus story, with it being reframed as constituting the Israelites' inspiring national myth narrative. The Israelites and their culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on Yahweh, one of the Ancient Canaanite deities. The growth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of cultic practices, gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite ethnic group, setting them apart from other Canaanites. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age), and the Canaanites are archeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age, while the Hebrew language is the last extant member of the Canaanite languages. In the Iron Age I period (1200–1000 BCE) Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature.</p>
		<p> Although the Israelites were divided into Twelve Tribes, the Jews (being one offshoot of the Israelites, another being the Samaritans) are traditionally said to descend mostly from the Israelite tribes of Judah (from where the Jews derive their ethnonym) and Benjamin, and partially from the tribe of Levi, who had together formed the ancient Kingdom of Judah, and the remnants of the northern Kingdom of Israel who migrated to the Kingdom of Judah and assimilated after the 720s BCE, when the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.</p>
		<p> After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman "Judean" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from "Israelites" to "Jews" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BCE Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BCE, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.</p>
		<p> Genetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East, and that they bear their strongest resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent. The genetic composition of different Jewish groups shows that Jews share a common genetic pool dating back 4,000 years, as a marker of their common ancestral origin. Despite their long-term separation, Jewish communities maintained commonalities in culture, tradition, and language.</p>
		<p> Judaism</p>
		<p> Main article: Judaism</p>
		<p> The Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated. Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it. However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many of the born-Jews. Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or by would-be or current spouses of Jews.</p>
		<p> The Hebrew Bible, a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews, established the first of the Abrahamic religions, which are now practiced by 54% of the world. Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a "way of life," which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, Jewish culture, and Jewish identity rather difficult. Throughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world, in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment (see Haskalah), in Islamic Spain and Portugal, in North Africa and the Middle East, India, China, or the contemporary United States and Israel, cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities.</p>
		<p> Babylon and Rome</p>
		<p> After the destruction of the Second Temple Judaism lost much of its sectarian nature. Nevertheless, a significant Hellenized Diaspora remained, centered in Alexandria, at the time the largest urban Jewish community in the world. Hellenism was a force not just in the Diaspora but also in the Land of Israel over a long period of time. Generally, scholars view Rabbinic Judaism as having been meaningfully influenced by Hellenism.</p>
		<p> Without a Temple, Greek speaking Jews no longer looked to Jerusalem in the way they had before. Judaism separated into a linguistically Greek and a Hebrew / Aramaic sphere.: 8–11 The theology and religious texts of each community were distinctively different.: 11–13 Hellenized Judaism never developed yeshivas to study the Oral Law. Rabbinic Judaism (centered in the Land of Israel and Babylon) almost entirely ignores the Hellenized Diaspora in its writings.: 13–14 Hellenized Judaism eventually disappeared as its practitioners assimilated into Greco-Roman culture, leaving a strong Rabbinic eastern Diaspora with large centers of learning in Babylon.: 14–16</p>
		<p> By the first century, the Jewish community in Babylonia, to which Jews were exiled after the Babylonian conquest as well as after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, already held a speedily growing population of an estimated one million Jews, which increased to an estimated two million between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel, making up about one-sixth of the world Jewish population at that era. The 13th-century author Bar Hebraeus gave a figure of 6,944,000 Jews in the Roman world Salo Wittmayer Baron considered the figure convincing. The figure of seven million within and one million outside the Roman world in the mid-first century became widely accepted, including by Louis Feldman. However, contemporary scholars now accept that Bar Hebraeus based his figure on a census of total Roman citizens. The figure of 6,944,000 being recorded in Eusebius' Chronicon. Louis Feldman, previously an active supporter of the figure, now states that he and Baron were mistaken.: 185 Feldman's views on active Jewish missionizing have also changed. While viewing classical Judaism as being receptive to converts, especially from the second century BCE through the first century CE, he points to a lack of either missionizing tracts or records of the names of rabbis who sought converts, as evidence for the lack of active Jewish missionizing.: 205–06 Feldman maintains that conversion to Judaism was common and the Jewish population was large both within the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora.: 183–203, 206 Other historians believe that conversion during the Roman era was limited in number and did not account for much of the Jewish population growth, due to various factors such as the illegality of male conversion to Judaism in the Roman world from the mid-second century. Another factor that made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal.</p>
		<p> Who is a Jew?</p>
		<p> Main articles: Who is a Jew? and Jewish identity</p>
		<p> Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used. Generally, in modern secular usage Jews include three groups: people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion, those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent), and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion.</p>
		<p> Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because " will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." Leviticus 24:10 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by Ezra 10:2–3, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. Since the anti-religious Haskalah movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.</p>
		<p> According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (Kil'ayim). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother.</p>
		<p> Ethnic divisions</p>
		<p> Within the world's Jewish population there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: political, cultural, natural, and populational. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.</p>
		<p> Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim. Ashkenazim, or "Germanics" (Ashkenaz meaning "Germany" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their German Jewish cultural and geographical origins, while Sephardim, or "Hispanics" (Sefarad meaning "Spain/Hispania" or "Iberia" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their Spanish/Portuguese Jewish cultural and geographic origins. The more common term in Israel for many of those broadly called Sephardim, is Mizrahim (lit. "Easterners", Mizrach being "East" in Hebrew), that is, in reference to the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews who are often, as a group, referred to collectively as Sephardim (together with Sephardim proper) for liturgical reasons, although Mizrahi Jewish groups and Sephardi Jews proper are ethnically distinct.</p>
		<p> Smaller groups include, but are not restricted to, Indian Jews such as the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews, and Bene Ephraim; the Romaniotes of Greece; the Italian Jews ("Italkim" or "Bené Roma"); the Teimanim from Yemen; various African Jews, including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; and Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities.</p>
		<p> The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African, Central Asian, Caucasian, and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are no closer related to each other than they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are sometimes termed Sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Egyptian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Mountain Jews, Georgian Jews, Iranian Jews and various others. The Teimanim from Yemen are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.</p>
		<p> Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the Holocaust). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim. Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population.</p>
		<p> Languages</p>
		<p> Hebrew is the liturgical language of Judaism (termed lashon ha-kodesh, "the holy tongue"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures (Tanakh) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries. By the 5th century BCE, Aramaic, a closely related tongue, joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea. By the 3rd century BCE, some Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek. Others, such as in the Jewish communities of Babylonia, were speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, the languages of the Babylonian Talmud. These languages were also used by the Jews of Israel at that time.</p>
		<p> For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became independent languages. Yiddish is the Judæo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe. Ladino is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula. Due to many factors, including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world, ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several communities, including Judæo-Georgian, Judæo-Arabic, Judæo-Berber, Krymchak, Judæo-Malayalam and many others, have largely fallen out of use.</p>
		<p> For over sixteen centuries Hebrew was used almost exclusively as a liturgical language, and as the language in which most books had been written on Judaism, with a few speaking only Hebrew on the Sabbath. Hebrew was revived as a spoken language by Eliezer ben Yehuda, who arrived in Palestine in 1881. It had not been used as a mother tongue since Tannaic times. Modern Hebrew is now one of the two official languages of the State of Israel along with Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
		<p> Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic or Berber as their mother tongue.</p>
		<p> Genetic studies</p>
		<p> Main article: Genetic studies on Jews</p>
		<p> Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities "showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect." Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude "Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons."</p>
		<p> Studies of autosomal DNA, which look at the entire DNA mixture, have become increasingly important as the technology develops. They show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry in common. For Jewish populations of the diaspora, the genetic composition of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jewish populations show a predominant amount of shared Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Behar, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared Middle Eastern ancestry is that it is "consistent with the historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelite residents of the Levant" and "the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World". North African, Italian and others of Iberian origin show variable frequencies of admixture with non-Jewish historical host populations among the maternal lines. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European, while Mizrahi Jews show evidence of admixture with other Middle Eastern populations and Sub-Saharan Africans. Behar et al. have remarked on an especially close relationship of Ashkenazi Jews and modern Italians. Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to Arabs.</p>
		<p> The studies also show that persons of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin (those who are descendants of the "anusim" who were forced to convert to Catholicism) throughout today's Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Ibero-America (Hispanic America and Brazil), estimated at up to 19.8% of the modern population of Iberia and at least 10% of the modern population of Ibero-America, have Sephardic Jewish ancestry within the last few centuries. The Bene Israel and Cochin Jews of India, Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and a portion of the Lemba people of Southern Africa, meanwhile, despite more closely resembling the local populations of their native countries, also have some more remote ancient Jewish descent.</p>
		<p> Demographics</p>
		<p> Further information: Jewish population by country</p>
		<p> Population centers</p>
		<p> Main article: Jewish population by urban areas</p>
		<p> According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics there were 13,421,000 Jews worldwide in 2009, roughly 0.19% of the world's population at the time.</p>
		<p> According to the 2007 estimates of The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, the world's Jewish population is 13.2 million. Adherents.com cites figures ranging from 12 to 18 million. These statistics incorporate both practicing Jews affiliated with synagogues and the Jewish community, and approximately 4.5 million unaffiliated and secular Jews.</p>
		<p> According to Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer of the Jewish population, in 2015 there were about 6.3 million Jews in Israel, 5.7 million in the United States, and 2.3 million in the rest of the world.</p>
		<p> Israel</p>
		<p> Main article: Israeli Jews</p>
		<p> Israel, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens. Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on 14 May 1948. Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, as of 2016, 14 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel (not including the Druze), most representing Arab political parties. One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel.</p>
		<p> Between 1948 and 1958, the Jewish population rose from 800,000 to two million. Currently, Jews account for 75.4% of the Israeli population, or 6 million people. The early years of the State of Israel were marked by the mass immigration of Holocaust survivors in the aftermath of the Holocaust and Jews fleeing Arab lands. Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews, many of whom were airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in Israel, about half being from the Soviet Union. This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western Europe, Latin America, and North America.</p>
		<p> A trickle of immigrants from other communities has also arrived, including Indian Jews and others, as well as some descendants of Ashkenazi Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Australia, Chile, and South Africa. Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, because of economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing Arab–Israeli conflict. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as yordim.</p>
		<p> Diaspora (outside Israel)</p>
		<p> Main article: Jewish diaspora</p>
		<p> The waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of Zionism and later events, including pogroms in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the founding of the state of Israel, with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century.</p>
		<p> More than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora (see Population table). Currently, the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world, is located in the United States, with 5.2 million to 6.4 million Jews by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000–300,000), and Brazil (196,000–600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America). Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world. Currently, a major national Jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not Israel has overtaken the United States in Jewish population.</p>
		<p> Western Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in France, home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (or their descendants). The United Kingdom has a Jewish community of 292,000. In Eastern Europe, there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million Jews living in the former Soviet Union, but exact figures are difficult to establish. In Germany, the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population, despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thousands of Israelis also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.</p>
		<p> Prior to 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world (excluding Israel). Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region, 15–20% in the Kingdom of Iraq, approximately 10% in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7% in the Kingdom of Yemen. A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century, although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria. The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948. The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in Iraq, Yemen and Libya, with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.</p>
		<p> Outside Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia, there are significant Jewish populations in Australia (112,500) and South Africa (70,000). There is also a 7,500-strong community in New Zealand.</p>
		<p> Demographic changes</p>
		<p> Main article: Historical Jewish population comparisons</p>
		<p> Assimilation</p>
		<p> Main articles: Jewish assimilation and Interfaith marriage in Judaism</p>
		<p> Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity. Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods, with some Jewish communities, for example the Kaifeng Jews of China, disappearing entirely. The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see Haskalah) and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community.</p>
		<p> Rates of interreligious marriage vary widely: In the United States, it is just under 50%, in the United Kingdom, around 53%; in France; around 30%, and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%. In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice. The result is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.</p>
		<p> War and persecution</p>
		<p> The Jewish people and Judaism have experienced various persecutions throughout Jewish history. During Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages the Roman Empire (in its later phases known as the Byzantine Empire) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population, first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and later by officially establishing them as second-class citizens during the Christian Roman era.</p>
		<p> According to James Carroll, "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."</p>
		<p> Later in medieval Western Europe, further persecutions of Jews by Christians occurred, notably during the Crusades—when Jews all over Germany were massacred—and a series of expulsions from the Kingdom of England, Germany, France, and, in the largest expulsion of all, Spain and Portugal after the Reconquista (the Catholic Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling Muslim Moors were expelled.</p>
		<p> In the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos.</p>
		<p> Islam and Judaism have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as dhimmis, were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by Bernard Lewis as "most degrading" was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly erratic. On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.</p>
		<p> Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al-Andalus in the 12th century, as well as in Islamic Persia, and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as mellahs beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century. In modern times, it has become commonplace for standard antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti-Zionist publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish Refah Partisi."</p>
		<p> Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Tomás de Torquemada) and the Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and autos-da-fé against the New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled. According to a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, 19.8% of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought.</p>
		<p> The persecution reached a peak in Nazi Germany's Final Solution, which led to the Holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6 million Jews. Of the world's 15 million Jews in 1939, more than a third were killed in the Holocaust. The Holocaust—the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews (and certain communities of North African Jews in European controlled North Africa) and other minority groups of Europe during World War II by Germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern-day persecution of Jews. The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages. Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in Eastern Europe, specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. Virtually every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal nation."</p>
		<p> Migrations</p>
		<p> Throughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the Land of Israel, and many of the areas in which they have settled. This experience as refugees has shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history. The incomplete list of major and other noteworthy migrations that follows includes numerous instances of expulsion or departure under duress:</p>
		<p> The mythical patriarch Abraham is described as a migrant to the land of Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees after an attempt on his life by King Nimrod.</p>
		<p> The Children of Israel, in the Biblical story whose historicity is uncertain, undertook the Exodus (meaning "departure" or "exit" in Greek) from ancient Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Exodus.</p>
		<p> Assyrian policy was to deport and displace conquered peoples, and it is estimated some 4,500,000 among captive populations suffered this dislocation over 3 centuries of Assyrian rule. With regard to Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III claims he deported 80% of the population of Lower Galilee, some 13,520 people. Some 27,000 Israelites, 20–25% of the population of the Kingdom of Israel, were described as being deported by Sargon II, and were replaced by other deported populations and sent into permanent exile by Assyria, initially to the Upper Mesopotamian provinces of the Assyrian Empire,</p>
		<p> Between 10,000 and 80,000 people from the Kingdom of Judah were exiled by Babylonia, then returned to Judea by Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, and then many were exiled again by the Roman Empire.</p>
		<p> The 2,000 year dispersion of the Jewish diaspora beginning under the Roman Empire, as Jews were spread throughout the Roman world and, driven from land to land, settled wherever they could live freely enough to practice their religion. Over the course of the diaspora the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to the Iberian Peninsula to Poland to the United States and, as a result of Zionism, back to Israel.</p>
		<p> Many expulsions during the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in Europe, including: 1290, 16,000 Jews were expelled from England, see the (Statute of Jewry); in 1396, 100,000 from France; in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of these Jews settled in Eastern Europe, especially Poland.</p>
		<p> Following the Spanish Inquisition in 1492, the Spanish population of around 200,000 Sephardic Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and Catholic church, followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and North Africa, others migrating to Southern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
		<p> During the 19th century, France's policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of Jews (especially from Eastern and Central Europe).</p>
		<p> The arrival of millions of Jews in the New World, including immigration of over two million Eastern European Jews to the United States from 1880 to 1925, see History of the Jews in the United States and History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union.</p>
		<p> The pogroms in Eastern Europe, the rise of modern antisemitism, the Holocaust, and the rise of Arab nationalism all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent, until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel.</p>
		<p> The Islamic Revolution of Iran caused many Iranian Jews to flee Iran. Most found refuge in the US (particularly Los Angeles) and Israel. Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe.</p>
		<p> When the Soviet Union collapsed, many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been refuseniks) were suddenly allowed to leave. This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s.</p>
		<p> Growth</p>
		<p> Israel is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population growth, although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.</p>
		<p> Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytism to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples.</p>
		<p> There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the Baal Teshuva movement) for secular Jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown. Additionally, there is also a growing rate of conversion to Jews by Choice of gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.</p>

	eArt: `<p> Language, the way in which men communicate their thoughts through a succession of words, gestures and expressions adapted to their character, customs and climate.</p>
		<p> Ever since man felt the urge, the need and the pleasure to associate with those similar to him, it became necessary for him to reveal his soul and to communicate situations to others. After trying several forms of expression, he settled on the most natural, useful and extensive of these: the voice. He was delighted to make use of it at each and every moment and opportunity, and with little effort other than respiratory movements, which are so natural to our existence.</p>
		<p> To judge things by their nature, stated Warburthon, one should not hesitate to adopt the opinion of Diodorus Siculus and other ancient philosophers, who thought that the first humans lived for a time like animals in woods and caves and, just like these animals, uttered only muddled and indeterminate sounds, until when gathered for mutual needs, and through a long process, they managed to form more distinct and varied sounds using signs and arbitrary marks, which they agreed upon in order that anyone who spoke could express the ideas he wished to communicate to others.</p>
		<p> This theory of the origin of language is so natural that a Father of the Church, Gregory of Nyssa, and Richard Simon, priest of the Oratory, worked together to confirm it; but revelation should have taught them that God himself taught man language , and it was not in the capacity of philosopher that the author of Connaissances humaines [Condillac] showed ingeniously how language could be formed by natural means.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, although God taught us language , it would apparently not be reasonable to posit that this language should extend beyond the contemporary needs of man, and that man should not have his own capacity to hear, enrich and improve language . Daily experience suggests the contrary. In this way, the first human language, as is proven by ancient monuments, was inevitably highly sterile and limited: so much so that men perpetually found themselves at a loss at each new idea and at each slightly unexpected situation, to make each other understood.</p>
		<p> Nature therefore led man to anticipate such disadvantages by adding meaning to words. Consequently, conversations in the first centuries were supported by speech interspersed with gestures, pictures and actions. Usage and custom, as has happened in most other areas of life, then transformed what was born out of necessity into something ornate; but the practice lasted for a long time after necessity ceased to be an issue.</p>
		<p> This is what occurred curiously with the Orientals, whose character naturally accommodated a form of conversation that clearly demonstrated their vivacity through movement, and fulfilled this vivacity through a permanent representation of perceptible images.</p>
		<p> Holy scripture provides us with countless examples of this type of conversation. When the false prophet raises his iron horns to mark the total defeat of the Syrians, ch. iii , Kings, 22.11 ; when Jeremiah hides his linen sash in the hole of a rock near the Euphrates, ch. xiii ; when he breaks a clay jar in view of the people, ch. xix ; and when he puts straps and rushes on his neck, ch. xxviii ; when Ezekiel etches the siege of Jerusalem onto a brick, ch. iv ; when he weighs the hair from his head and his beard on some scales, ch. v ; when he takes his belongings from his home, ch. xij ; and when he joins two sticks together for Judah and Israel, ch. xxxvii . In all of the actions the prophets conversed with the people using symbols, which the people understood marvellously.</p>
		<p> One should not treat as absurd and fanatical this language of action that the prophets used, for they were speaking to an unrefined people who knew no other language. In each and every nation of the world, the language of articulated sounds has prevailed only where it has become more intelligible to such nations.</p>
		<p> The beginnings of this language of articulated sounds have always been ill-defined; and when they were refined with time and achieved their perfection, one could no longer hear the stuttering of their initial stages. Under the reign of Numa and for 500 years after him, neither Greek nor Roman was spoken in Rome. Instead, it was a vernacular formed out of Greek and barbarian words: for example, they would say pa for parte , and pro for populo . Polybus thus stated somewhere that in his time researching history, he had great difficulty finding one or two citizens in Rome who, though very learned in the history of their country, were in a position to explain to him some of the treaties the Romans had made with the Carthaginians; and that they had therefore written in the language spoken at the time. It was the sciences and the fine arts that were to enrich and perfect the Roman language. Due to the expanse of their empire it was to become the dominant language, albeit greatly inferior to the language of the Greeks.</p>
		<p> But if men who were born to live among others discovered in the end the art of communicating their thoughts with precision, finesse and energy, they were no less able to hide and disguise them through false expressions, and they would abuse language .</p>
		<p> Vocal expression can also be considered in the variety and succession of its movements: hence we find the art of music. This expression can find new force in the general convention of ideas: hence we find speech, poetry and the art of oratory.</p>
		<p> The voice, being but a sensitive and drawn out expression, must have as its essential principle the imitation of the movements, restlessness and emotions of what it aims to express. Thus, when certain vocal inflections are placed on certain objects, one should [p. 243] be attentive to the sounds with the best relationship to what one wishes to describe. If there were a language in which this relationship was rigorously followed, it would be a universal language.</p>
		<p> But differences in climate, custom and temperament are such that the inhabitants of the earth are neither equally perceptive nor equally affected. The shrewd and active spirit of the Orientals, and their hot-headed disposition, which would find its form in deep emotions, must have led them to invent idioms whose loud and harmonious sounds were vivid images of the objects they expressed. Hence the widely used metaphors and bold figures, the images inspired by nature, the strong inversions, the frequent display of similes and the sublime nature of the great writers of Antiquity.</p>
		<p> The people of the north, living in very cold conditions, must have placed a lesser degree of fiery passion in their language . They had to express the few emotions present in their sensibility. From their affections and their sentiments, this must have necessarily found its way into their expressions. The language of an inhabitant of the north must have been permeated with all the iciness of his climate.</p>
		<p> The Frenchman, who found himself between these two extremities, must have prevented himself using expressions that were too figurative, movements that were too fast and images that were too vivid. Since it was not for him to follow the vehemence and the sublime nature of the oriental languages, he must have settled on a form of elegant clarity, a studied politesse , using cold and delicate movements, which are all expressions of his temperament. It is not that the French language is not capable of harmony and vivid imagery, but these qualities have never been widely established.</p>
		<p> It is not only the language of each nation, but also that of each region, that draws influence from climate and custom. In the southern regions of France one speaks a vernacular compared to which French is without movement and without action. In climates warmed by a blazing sun, the same word will often express an object and an action. Nowhere can we find the dispassionate climaxes whereby things are slowly examined, judged and condemned: the mind quickly examines successive nuances and, at a one glance, spots the principle and the end that is expressed with necessary determination.</p>
		<p> Men who are only capable of cold accuracy in their reasoning and actions would appear to be numb beings, whilst these very men would find that the blazing sun had affected the minds of their compatriots. Where displaced men could not follow the speed of something, they would perceive inconsistencies and gaps. Between these two extremes, there are nuances of force, clarity and exactitude in language , just as in every climate there are successions of warm and cold.</p>
		<p> Custom also introduces great variety in this domain. Those who live in the country know about rural work and pleasures: their speech is thus influenced by images of nature, hence the pastoral genre. The politesse of the court and the town inspire similes and metaphors drawn from the delicate and voluptuous metaphysics of the sentiments: hence the language of polite society.</p>
		<p> The varieties found during a single century can also be found by comparing different eras. The Romans, with the same arm that strengthened the leadership of the kings, laboriously cultivated the wealthy field of their forefathers. In this fierce, or better still, warrior nation, agriculture was an honour. Their language was marked by their customs, and Virgil completed a project that would have been very difficult for a Frenchman. This wise poet expressed in noble and heroic verses the tools used in ploughing, planting vines and harvesting grapes. He could not have imagined that in Augustus's era people, with their politesse , would not applaud the image of a village woman who, with a branch in hand, would skim the must she was boiling in order to vary nature's produce.</p>
		<p> Since different vernaculars are born out of the different characters of peoples, one can decide straight away that there will never be a universal language. Would it be possible to give every nation the same customs, the same sentiments, the same ideas of vice and virtue, and the same pleasure in the same images, whilst this difference is the result of the climates in which the peoples of nations live, of the education they receive and of their form of government?</p>
		<p> However, knowledge of various languages, at least those of cultured peoples, is a vehicle for the sciences, because it serves to unravel the great multitude of different concepts that men have developed for themselves: if we do not know languages, we resemble blind horses whose fate it is to follow the path of only a small circle, constantly turning the wheel of the same mill.</p>
		<p> Language. After having criticized the definition of the word language provided by Furetière, Frain du Tremblay says that ‘what we call language is a series or set of certain articulated sounds that can suitably be assembled together, and that a people uses to signify things and to communicate its thoughts; but that can be used indifferently to signify one thing or thought rather than another’ (Traité des langues, ch. ii .). Despite the extensive explanation that he then provides of the various parts that enter into this definition, rather than of the definition itself and of language as a whole, we can say that this writer has not succeeded better than did Furetière in giving us a precise and complete notion of what a language is; his definition is neither concise, clear nor true.</p>
		<p> The definition goes against the rules of concision by endeavoring to account in too much detail for the essence of articulated sounds, which really should not be examined so explicitly in a definition whose immediate object cannot be sounds.</p>
		<p> It goes against the rules of clarity by leaving an imprecision concerning the nature of what we call language , an imprecision that the author himself sensed and that he wished to remove by an entire chapter of explanation.</p>
		<p> Finally, it goes against the rules of truth by presenting the idea of a vocabulary in lieu of a language . A vocabulary is truly the series or set of words that a people uses to signify things and communicate its thoughts. But are only words necessary to constitute a language ; and to know it, is it necessary only to learn its vocabulary? Isn’t it necessary to know the primary and secondary meanings that make up the literal meaning that usage has attached to each word, as well as the various figurative meanings that it has ascribed to it, and furthermore the way in which usage allows them to be modified, combined and arranged to contribute to the expression of thoughts? To what extent, moreover, has usage subordinated their arrangement to the rules of syntax; and how, in which circumstances, and finally for what purpose has it liberated them from conforming to this arrangement? In languages everything is usage, including the materiality and meaning of words, the regularity and irregularity of endings, the restriction or freedom established by syntax, and the purism or barbarism of expressions. It is a truth felt by all those who have written on usage, but nonetheless a badly presented one when one says that usage is the tyrant of languages . The idea of tyranny carries with it for us a meaning of unjust usurpation and unreasonable government; and yet it is only right that the empire of usage should govern any language whatsoever since it alone can ascribe to the communication of thoughts – the object of speech – its necessary universality. Nothing is more reasonable than to follow its rules since we would not be understood without them, in complete opposition to the aim of speech.</p>
		<p> Usage is thus not the tyrant of languages , but their natural legislator who is both necessary and absolute. His decisions constitute their essence, and because of this I would say that a language is the totality of the usages proper to a nation to express its thoughts in speech .</p>
		<p> If a language is spoken by a nation made up of several peoples who are equal and independent in respect to each other and who generally use the same words and syntax, such as the Greeks in ancient times and the Italians and Germans today, each people can have its particular usages with respect to pronunciation or the endings of the same words, and these equally valid variations form the dialects of their national language . If the nation, like the Romans formerly and the French today, is united under one government, then there can only be one legitimate variant in its manner of speaking. All other usages that deviate in pronunciation, endings, syntax or in any other way do not make up a distinct language or dialect of the national language , but are simply a patois particular to the people of the provinces, each of which has its own.</p>
		<p> If among the range of linguistic usages characteristic of a nation we consider only the expression and communication of thoughts, insofar as these accord with the opinions that are the most universal and common among mankind, then the word language perfectly expresses this general idea. But if we desire also to take into consideration the particular opinions of this nation and the idiosyncrasies that these opinions necessarily produce in its speech, then the term idiom is most suitable to express this less general and narrower conception.</p>
		<p> The distinction that we have just drawn between language and idiom is even greater between language (langue) and langage [1] , although these two words seem significantly closer due to their shared etymology. It is the material aspect of words and their combination that determine a language , which is connected only to the ideas, conceptions and knowledge of its speakers. In contrast, langage appears more connected to the character of the speaker and to his views and interests; the object of speech determines langage , and ‘each develops his own in accordance with his passions’, said l'abbé de Condillac (Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines II. Part. 1. sect. ch. xv). Thus, one nation with one language can at different times have different langages if it has changed its customs, opinions and interests; two nations with two different languages , on the other hand, may have the same langage if they have the same customs, opinions and interests. In other words, national customs derive from national passions, and the former change along with the latter. The same is true for men as for nations; one speaks of the langage of eyes and of gestures since both eyes and gestures naturally follow the movements of the passions, and consequently express them with all the more energy as the correspondence is greater between the sign and the thing signified that produces it.</p>
		<p> After having thus determined the true meaning of the word language by the most explicit definition that it could possibly be given and by a precise exposition of the differences that distinguish it from words that are either synonymous with or subordinate to it, it remains necessary to take a philosophical look at what pertains to languages in general. It seems to me that this theory can be divided into three principal topics that are the only ones that can be treated philosophically and thus by the Encyclopedia, and that treat the origins of the first language , the miraculous division of languages , and, finally, the analysis and comparison of languages when viewed in their most general aspects. That which concerns the study of languages will be found treated throughout the various articles of this work, and particularly under the entry [Method].</p>
		<p> Moreover, with respect to what pertains to languages in general, one can consult several works addressing this subject: the philosophical essays by H. Schaevius, De origine linguarum & quibusdam carum attributis ; an essay by Borrichius, a Danish physician, De causis diversitatis linguarum ; other essays by Thomas Hayne, De linguarum harmoniâ , in which he addresses languages in general and the similarity among different idioms; the work by Théodore Bibliander, De ratione communi omnium linguarum et litterarum , the one by Gesner, titled Mithridates , which more or less has the same object, and also that of forming a universal language from the combination of different languages ; Le trésor de l'histoire des langues de cet univers by Claude Duret; L'harmonie étymologique des langues by Etienne Guichart; Le traité des langues by Frain du Tremblay; Les réflexions philosophiques sur l'origine des langues by Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, and several other observations scattered in different texts that, although they do not treat this subject directly, contain excellent principles and useful opinions on it.</p>
		<p> Article I. The origin of the first language . Some people have thought that the first humans, born mute, lived for some time like isolated brutes in caves and forests without any connection to each other, uttering only confused and vague sounds until the fear of wild beasts, the powerful voice of need and the necessity of assisting each other drove them together. They gradually became able to articulate their sounds more distinctly, to adopt them by unanimous convention as signs of their ideas or of the things that were their objects, and finally to form themselves a language . This is the opinion of Diodorus Siculus and Vitruvius, and it also seemed probable to Richard Simon who adopted it all the more audaciously insofar as he quoted Saint Gregory of Nyssa in its favor (Histoire critique du Vieux Testament, I. xiv. xv. & III. xxi.; Contra Eunomium XII.). Père Thomassin claims, however, that far from defending this opinion the Doctor of the Church fights against it in the same passage taken to support it; and many other passages of this holy Father clearly prove that he had very different opinions on this topic and that Richard Simon understood him poorly.</p>
		<p> ‘To judge solely by the nature of things’, says Warburton, ‘and independently of Revelation, which is however a more certain guide, we would be inclined to admit Diodorus Siculus and Vitruvius’s opinion’ (Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens [2] e. I. p. 48. in footnote). This way of thinking on the present question is less daring and more cautious than the former; yet Diodorus Siculus and Vitruvius were perhaps even less worthy of criticism than the English writer. Guided only by the lights of reason, it would be quite natural that if they overlooked some important fact they would also fail to see its consequences. However, it is difficult to imagine how one can adduce Revelation with the degree of submissiveness that it has the right to demand and nevertheless claim that the nature of things insinuates opposing principles. Reason and Revelation are, so to speak, two different channels that bring us water from the same spring, and they only differ in the way in which they present it; the channel of Revelation places us closer to the source and offers it to us in a more distilled form; whereas the channel of reason keeps us at a greater distance from it and exposes us to a greater risk of diverse impurities, even if these impurities are always discernible and their elimination always possible. From this it follows that the light of reason can never be opposed to that of Revelation, and consequently that the first must not reach a different judgment than the other regarding the origin of languages .</p>
		<p> To imagine or admit of hypotheses contrary to several facts made known by Revelation in order to explain natural facts is thus to contradict without modesty or success the most authentic account that has been given on truth by the author of all truths. Notwithstanding the reason and authority of the many authors who believed to have done well by entertaining the supposition of savage man in order to explain the origin and the successive development of language , I dare say that of all possible hypotheses this one is the least tenable.</p>
		<p> In the first part of his Discours sur l'origine et les fondemens de l'inegalité parmi les hommes , J. J. Rousseau based his research on this humiliating supposition that humans were born savage and without any connection to the other individuals of their species than the one that they also shared with the animals by dint of simple cohabitation in the same forests. What advantage did he draw from this chimerical hypothesis to explain the fact of the origin of languages ? He encountered in it only the greatest difficulties and is forced in the end to admit that they are insoluble.</p>
		<p> ‘The first difficulty that we encounter,’ he says, ‘is to imagine how languages could have become necessary, since humans having no contact with one another and no need to have any, we cannot conceive of either the necessity of this invention, or its possibility assuming it were not indispensable. I would happily say, like many others, that languages were born in the domestic relations between fathers, mothers and children, but apart from the fact that this does not answer the objections, it would be to commit the same error as those who, reflecting on the state of nature, introduce ideas drawn from society and always imagine the family living under the same roof and with a bond between its members that is as intimate and permanent as in our society, where so many common interests unite them. Instead, in this original state, having neither houses, huts nor property of any kind, each individual found his own accommodation at random and often for a single night, while males and females united fortuitously according to their encounters, opportunities and desires, without speech being a necessary means of communication for what they wanted to express. They parted on the same easy terms. The mother breastfed her infants initially to satisfy her own needs while afterwards, habit having made them dear to her, she then fed them to satisfy theirs. As soon as they had the strength to search for their own food, they did not think twice before leaving their own mother. Because almost the only way of finding each other was to avoid losing sight of one other, very soon they arrived at the point of no longer being able to recognize each other. Note moreover that the child needing to explain all of its needs and consequently having more things to say to its mother than vice versa, it is he who must make the greatest effort of invention and the language that he uses must be primarily his own creation. Now, this would create as many languages as there are speaking individuals, to which must be added the influence of a nomadic and unsettled mode of life that does not allow any particular idiom the time to become stable. To say on the other hand that the mother teaches the child the words that he must use to request anything from her shows clearly how already existing languages are taught, but it does not teach us how they were formed.</p>
		<p> Suppose this first difficulty overcome and that we may pass over for a moment the immense lapse of time between the pure state of nature and the need of languages , and let us consider, supposing that languages were necessary, how they might have begun to get established. A new difficulty, even worse than the first, now arises. For if human beings needed speech to learn how to think, they would have also needed to know how to think to discover the art of speech. Even if one understood how the sounds of the voice came to be used as conventional signs of our ideas, we would still be left with the question of how it was that this convention first came to be established, the convention lacking any perceivable object and consequently unable to be indicated by gestures or by the voice. As a result, it is almost impossible to make plausible conjectures about the birth of this art for the communication of thought and the facilitation of exchange among minds.</p>
		<p> The first language of human beings, the most universal and energetic one, and the only one needed before it was necessary to persuade men gathered together in assemblies is the cry of nature. Since this cry was only expressed by a sort of instinct in urgent situations in order to beg for help in great moments of danger or for relief from violent pain, it was not used frequently in everyday life, where moderate emotions were dominant. When men's ideas started to develop and multiply, and more intimate contacts became established among them, they sought more numerous signs and a more sophisticated language ; they multiplied the inflexions of the voice and added gestures to it, which, by their nature, are more expressive and whose meaning is less dependent on a prior convention. They thus signified visible and mobile objects by means of gestures, and objects that affect the sense of hearing by imitative sounds; but since gestures only indicate objects that are present or easy to describe or visible actions, they cannot be employed in all circumstances since darkness or the interposition of another body makes them useless, and since they require attention more than they attract it. Finally, it was decided to substitute for gestures the articulations of the voice, which, without having the same connections to particular ideas, are more appropriate to represent ideas in general, as conventional signs. This substitution could not have been made without mutual consent and in a manner that was quite hard to implement for men whose coarse organs had not yet any practice, and that was even harder to conceive in itself since this unanimous agreement must have been deliberate, and since speech seems to have been very necessary in order to institute the usage of speech.</p>
		<p> We must suppose that the first words used by men had in their minds a meaning that is much broader than those used in already developed languages , and that ignorant of the separation of discourse into its parts, they initially gave to each word the meaning of an entire clause. Even when they began to distinguish the subject from the attribute and the verb from the noun, which itself required no small amount of ingenuity, nouns were not more than proper nouns, the infinitive was the only verb tense, and as for adjectives, their use would only develop after great efforts, because all adjectives are abstract words and abstractions are difficult and not very natural.</p>
		<p> Each object was first given a particular name without regard for species and kind, which these first grammarians were not in a position to discern, and all individual objects presented themselves as separate to their minds, just as they are in nature. If one oak was called A, the next was called B, such that the more knowledge was limited, the more the dictionary was copious. The awkwardness of all this nomenclature could not be removed easily, since to classify things under common and generic denominations, it was first necessary to know their properties and differences; observations and definitions were necessary; that is, a knowledge of natural history and metaphysics to a much larger extent than the men of this time could have possessed.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, general ideas cannot present themselves to the mind without the help of words, and the understanding only grasps them in propositions. This is one of the reasons why animals cannot form such ideas, nor ever acquire the perfectibility that depends on them. When a monkey goes without hesitating from one nut to another, do we think that it has a general idea of this kind of fruit and that it compares the two nuts to an archetype? Certainly not, but the sight of one of these nuts reminds him of the sensations produced by the other, and his eyes, affected in a certain way, inform his sense of taste of the sensations that he will receive. All general ideas are purely intellectual; but as soon as the imagination gets involved, an idea immediately becomes particular. If you try to draw the image of a tree in general, you will never succeed, and despite yourself you will have to envisage it as small or large, wiry or leafy, light or dark, and if it was up to you to represent only what is true of all trees, this image would cease to resemble a tree. Purely abstract beings are either represented abstractly in this way, or can only be conceived in speech. The definition of a triangle alone gives you the real idea of it; as soon as you imagine one in your mind, it is a one triangle and not another and you will not be able to refrain from giving it tangible lines or color. It is thus necessary to utter propositions; it is thus necessary to speak, in order to have general ideas, because as soon as the imagination stops, the mind only continues to work with the help of discourse. If, then, the first inventors were only able to name ideas that they already possessed, it follows that the first nouns could never have been other than proper names.</p>
		<p> But when our new grammarians started to extend their ideas and generalize their words, by means that I cannot imagine, the ignorance of the inventors must have confined this method within highly restricted limits. Just as they had first excessively multiplied the names of individual objects for lack of any knowledge of species and kind, they then created too many species and kinds due to not having considered all the differences between individual beings. To take the distinctions far enough, they would have needed more experience and insight than they were able to acquire, and more research and work than they wanted to carry out. Now, if today we still discover new species each day that have escaped our observations thus far, how many must have escaped that of men who only judged things at their face value? As for primitive classes and the most general notions, it is superfluous to add that they must have escaped them also. How, for example, could they have imagined or understood the words matter , mind , substance , mode , figure , movement , when our philosophers, who have employed them for so long, have such a hard time understanding them, and when the ideas that we attach to these words, being purely metaphysical, lack any model in nature?’</p>
		<p> After having discussed at length the first obstacles in the path of the conventional institution of languages as we have just seen, Rousseau makes a term of comparison out of the invention of purely physical nouns, which make up the easiest part of language to identify in order to judge the journey remains to reach the point at which language can express all the thoughts of men, take on a stable form, be spoken in public and influence society. He invites the reader to reflect on the number of years and the amount of knowledge that must have been required in order to discover numbers, which require the most profound philosophical meditations and the most metaphysical, demanding and least natural form of abstraction; not to mention other abstract words, the aorists and all the verb tenses, the particles, syntax; and in order to connect clauses and reasonings, and to form the whole logic of speech. After this, he concludes as follows: ‘As for me, terrified by the difficulties that are accumulating and convinced of the almost demonstrated impossibility that languages could have been born and established by purely human means, I leave the discussion of this difficult problem for whomever wishes to undertake it: which was most necessary, society already established, for the institution of languages; or languages already invented, for the institution of society?’</p>
		<p> It was difficult to show in a clearer way the impossibility of deducing the origin of languages from the revolting hypothesis of a supposedly savage man in the early days of the world. To make its absurdity clear, it seemed important to me to omit nothing from the confessions of a philosopher who had adopted it to establish a foundation for the inequality of conditions, and who, despite the acumen and the subtlety for which he is known, was not able to draw from this chimeric principle all the advantage that it promised, and perhaps not even the one that he himself believes he had obtained.</p>
		<p> Allow me to reflect for a moment longer on these last remarks. The Genevan philosopher rightly felt that the inequality of conditions was a necessary consequence of the establishment of society, and that the establishment of society and the institution of language were mutually dependent on each other, since he sees it as a difficult problem to discuss which of the two was a more necessary condition for the other. Why then does he not take his argument further? Having seen it demonstrated that languages could not result from the hypothesis that men were born savages, nor could be established by purely human means, why does he not draw the same conclusion regarding society? Why does he not fully abandon his hypothesis as equally incapable of explaining each institution? Besides, the supposition of a fact that we know by the most reliable account not to have existed, far from being admissible as an explanatory principle of real facts, must not be regarded as anything but a chimeric fiction liable to lead us astray.</p>
		<p> But let’s follow simple reasoning. A language is without a doubt the set of the particular usages of a nation to express thoughts by means of the voice, and this expression is the means by which these thoughts are communicated. All languages thus presuppose a pre-existing society that, as such, must have had a need for this communication, and that, for reasons already stated, must have established the usages that constitute the body of its language . On the other hand, a society formed by any human means that we can ascertain presupposes a means of communication in order, first, to determine the respective duties of its members, and then to set things up so that they can demand of each other that they satisfy them. What follows from this? If we persist in wanting to institute the first language and society by human means, it is necessary to admit the eternity of the world and of the generations of man, and consequently to give up the idea of a first society and a first language per se. Yet this is an absurd claim on its face, since it implies a contradiction, and is moreover refuted by right reason and the overwhelming number of all kinds of accounts that certify the newness of the world: Nulia igitur in principio facta est ejusmodi congregatio, nec unquam fuisse homines in terra qui propter insantiam non loquerentur, intelliget, cui ratio non deest . [3] Lactantius. Concerning the True Worship. ch. x. If men begin to exist without speaking, they will never speak. When one knows a few languages , one may easily invent another; but if one does not know one, one will never know one, unless one hears someone else speak. The organ of speech is an instrument that remains idle and useless if it is not set in motion by the sense impressions of the hearing. Nobody denies that it is their original deafness that keeps the mouth of people born mute inactivate, and one knows from more than one well-documented experience that men accidentally raised far from others and in the silence of forests, not having learnt to pronounce any articulated sound there, only imitated the natural screams of animals with whom they had come into contact, and transplanted into our society had great difficulties in imitating the language that they heard, and never did so except highly imperfectly. See the notes on the Discours sur l'origine et les fondemens de l'inegalité parmi les hommes by J-J Rousseau.</p>
		<p> Herodotus tells the story of an Egyptian king who raised two children together in silence and with a goat for wet-nurse, and that after two years they reached out their hand to the one responsible for this experimental education, and said to him ‘beccos’, and that the king, knowing that bek meant bread in Phrygian, concluded that the Phrygian language was natural, and that the Phrygians were the most ancient people in the world (book. II. ch. ii.). The Egyptians did not renounce their claims to antiquity, despite this decision of their prince, and they were right not to do so: it is evident that his children spoke like the goat that nourished them, that the Greek called βήκη [4] from onomatopoeia or imitation of this animal’s bleat, and this bleat only resembles the Phrygian bek (bread) by pure accident.</p>
		<p> If the conclusion that the Egyptian king drew from this observation was badly deduced, it was even more mistaken in its supposition of an erroneous principle that consists in believing that men had such a thing as a natural language . It is the thinking of those who, terrified by the difficulties of the system that we have just examined regarding the origin of languages , nonetheless believed that they should not claim that the first language miraculously came from the very inspiration of God.</p>
		<p> But if there was a language that originated in human nature, should it not be common to all of mankind without regard to time, climate, governments, religions, customs, acquired knowledge, prejudices, or any of the other causes that elicit the various differences among languages ? Would not those who are born mute, and whom we know are such only insofar as they cannot hear, at least try to speak this natural language , especially considering that it would not have been suppressed by any usage or opposing prejudice?</p>
		<p> That which is truly natural to man is as immutable as his essence. Today, just as from the dawn of time, a secret but invincible inclination places a constant desire for happiness in his soul, suggests to the two sexes this mutual concupiscence that perpetuates the species, and knows how to transmit from generation to generation this aversion to solitude that never disappears even in the hearts of those whom wisdom or religion has led to live apart from other men. But let us move closer to our object: don’t we see that the natural language of each species of the brutes is unchanging? From the beginning up to our times, everywhere the lions have been heard to roar, the bulls bellow, the horses neigh, the asses bray, the dogs bark, the wolves howl, the cats miaow, etc. These words, formed in all languages by means of onomatopoeia, bear witness to the distinctiveness of the langage of every species, and the incorruptibility, if one may say so, of each specific idiom.</p>
		<p> I do not claim to insinuate, moreover, that the language of animals is able to represent an analytic summary of their thoughts, nor that it is able to grant them a reason comparable to ours, as thought Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus, Porphyry, and as certain moderns have suggested, among them Isaac Vossius who went so far as to assert indecently that there is more reason in the langage of animals, ‘ vulgò bruta creduntur’  [5], he says (De poematum cantu et viribus rythmi p. 66). I have explained myself on this point elsewhere. See Interjection. Speech is given to us to express the interior feelings of our soul, and the ideas that we have of external objects, such that each of the languages that human beings speak, provides a means of expression for the langage of the heart and that of the mind. The langage of animals seems to only have interior sensations as its object, and it is because of this that this language is as invariable as is their manner of feeling, even if the invariability of their langage does not of itself supply the proof of this. The same is true for us; everywhere we communicate the actual state of our soul in our interjections, since the sounds that nature dictates in the big and small movements of our soul are the same in all languages ; our usages are in this respect never arbitrary since they are natural. The same would be the case with the analytic language of the mind, if it were natural, it would be unchanging and unique.</p>
		<p> What conclusion is thus left for us to draw in order to determine a plausible origin for language ? The hypothesis of savage man, contradicted by the authentic history of Genesis, can moreover not suggest any plausible means for the formation of a first language ; to suppose that this language was natural is another hypothesis that is incompatible with the constant and uniform procedures of nature. It is thus God himself who, unsatisfied with giving the precious faculty of speech to the two first individuals of the human species, promptly had them fully exercise it by immediately inspiring them with the desire and the art of imagining the words and expressions necessary for the needs of emerging society. This is more or less what the author seems to be saying in the ecclesiastical: ‘ Consilium, & linguam, & oculos, & aures, & cor dedit illis excogitandi; & disciplinâ intellectûs explevit illos’ [6] (XVII. 5). This is exactly everything that is necessary to justify my opinion: the desire to communicate one’s thoughts, consilium ; the ability to do it, linguam ; eyes to recognize surrounding objects from afar that are subject to the human domain, in order to distinguish them by their names, oculos ; ears in order to mutually understand one another, without which the communication of thoughts and the traditions of usages that serve to express them would be impossible, aures ; the art of subjecting words to laws of a certain analogy to avoid an excessive multiplication of primitive words, but nonetheless to give to each being its own sign, cor excogitandi ; finally, the necessary intelligence to distinguish and name the most important abstract points of view in order to give to the whole of a speech a form as expressive as each of its individual parts, and then to memorize the whole, disciplina intellectus. This doctrine is confirmed by the passage in Genesis that teaches us that it was Adam who gave the first names to the animals, and that presents him as occupied with this task by the expressed desire and under the direction of the Creator (Genesis 2:19-20). Formatis igitur, Dominus Deus, de humo cunctis animantibas terroe, & universis volatilibus coeli, adduxit ea ad Adam, ut videret quid vocaret ea; omne enim quod vocavit Adam animae viventis, ipsum est nomen ejus: ap. pellavitque Adam nominibus sais cuncta animantia, & universa volatilia coeli, & omnes bestias terroe . [7] With such a respectable and well-established account of the real origin of both society and language , how can we still find among us men who dare to interpret the work of God by the delusions of their imagination, and to substitute their thoughts for the documents that the Holy Spirit himself has given us? Unless one is to introduce what is at once both the most ridiculous and the most scandalous historical Pyrrhonism, the account of Moses has the right to compel the assent of any rational man more than any other historian. He is so certain of his dates that he continually speaks as a man who has no fear of being contradicted by any previous example, however short the distance from his time that he situates this origin; such is the stringent condition that he imposes when he speaks of the first division of languages ; a miraculous incident that merits attention and for which I will borrow the terms of Pluche (Le spectacle de la nature tom. VIII. part. I. page 96. and cont.).</p>
		<p> Article II. The miraculous division of languages. ‘Moses has the whole human species gathered on the Euphrates in the city of Babel, and speaking only one language, about eight hundred years before his times. His whole story would be contradicted by just two earlier examples of writing in different languages . A man, acting with this confidence, doubtless finds the proof and not the refutation of his dates in the Egyptian monuments perfectly known to him. The very precision of his story refutes in advance all the fables subsequently introduced in the Egyptian annals.</p>
		<p> This historical point is significant. Let us examine it in parts and compare Moses's account with what nature and society offer us as remnants and proofs of what he puts forward.</p>
		<p> The children of Noah, numerous and uncomfortable in the rocks of Ararat where the ark had stranded, crossed the Tigris and chose the fertile countrysides of Sinjar or Sennahar in lower Mesopotamia, somewhere near the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates, in order to settle in what was the richest and most unified land that they knew. The necessity to provide for the needs of an enormous population of men and livestock obliging them to spread out, and not having any object in this immense plain that could be perceived from afar. ‘Let’s build a town,’ they said, ‘and a tower that reaches the sky. Let’s make a recognizable mark [8] in order not to become disunited as we disperse in all directions. Lacking stones, they baked bricks, and the asphalt or bitumen that the land provided them with in abundance served instead of cement. God decided that it was necessary to stop this undertaking by diversifying their language . Confusion spread among them and this place took the name Babel , which means confusion. Was there a town with the name Babel , a known tower that had accompanied this town, a plain named Sinjar or Sennahar in Mesopotamia, a river called Euphrates , and infinitely fertile and perfectly united countrysides, so as to make the precaution of a very high tower intelligible and reasonable? Moreover, is asphalt a natural product of this country? All of secular antiquity has known since the earliest times in which writing began, both the Euphrates, and the evenness of its plains. In his maps of Asia, Ptolemy has the plains of Mesopotamia end at the Sinhar mountains, on the side of the Tigris. Every historian talks about the perfect evenness of the lands on the Babylon side, where as a result beautiful gardens were elevated on several masses of brick buildings in order to detach them from the plain and to vary its otherwise too uniform appearance. Ammien Marcellin, who followed the emperor Julien into this country, as well as Pliny and all the geographers, both ancient and modern, attest in the same way the breadth and the evenness of the Mesopotamian lowlands, where no natural object exists to fix the horizon. They draw our attention to the abundance of bitumen that flows there naturally and the incredible fertility of ancient Babylonia. In this way, everything conspires to make us recognize the remains of the land of Eden and the exactitude of everything that Moses documents. All profane literature pays tribute to the Scripture, apart from the Chinese and Egyptian histories which proceed as if they were conceived in a vacuum.’</p>
		<p> The crime for which Moses blames the children of Noah, ‘is not, as the LXX have translated it, that of wanting to make a name of themselves before their scattering, but, as the original text literally shows, that of constructing a dwelling that could hold a numerous people, and to adjoin to it a tower that, seen from afar, became a rallying point, in order to prevent wandering and separation. This is what they express very simply in the following terms: let’s make a mark in order not to disunite ourselves when we move in different directions (Hebr. pen. ne forte.).</p>
		<p> The disadvantage that they wanted to avoid carefully was exactly what God wanted and required of them. They knew very well that God had called them for at least a century to distribute themselves in colonies each in different areas, and they took measures to prevent or postpone as long as possible the execution of his wishes. As a result, God confused their language ; he populated little by little each country in settling there those inhabitants who had gathered there due to their use of one particular language , and whom the inconvenience of no longer understanding the other families had obliged to live far from them.</p>
		<p> Both the current state of things on earth and every known history bear witness to the intention that very early after the flood divided up the languages . Nothing was more worthy of divine wisdom than to have used the same means to quickly populate the different corners of the earth that is still employed today to settle its inhabitants in one place and to prevent their departure from it. There are such good countries and there are such ill-favored ones that the latter would be abandoned for the former if the use of the same language was not such a strong attachment as to compel the inhabitants of the bad ones to remain there, and their ignorance of other languages a powerful reason to avoid the other countries despite the disadvantages of the comparison. Thus, the miracle reported by Moses even today populates the whole earth as truly as it did at the time of the scattering of the children of Noah; its effect continues to operate across the centuries.</p>
		<p> Another means to sense the accuracy of this story consists in the fact that the diversity of languages is in agreement with Moses’s dates; this diversity precedes all of our known histories, unlike either the pyramids of Egypt, or the marbles of Arundel or any other monument that carries with it a character of truth. Let us add here that the reunion of the human species in Chaldea before the dispersion of the colonies is a fact very much supported by the order in which they were established. Everything begins in the Orient, both men and the arts; everything advances closer and closer to the West, to the South and to the North. History shows kings and great civilizations in the heart and on the coasts of Asia at a time in which there was no knowledge of other, more remote colonies – these either did not yet exist or they were still in the process of being settled. If the Chinese and Egyptians had from very early times more similarities with the ancient inhabitants of Chaldea than other peoples, given their sedentary inclination, use of symbolic figures, astronomical knowledge, and their skill in several Fine Arts, it is primarily because they settled in extremely good regions in which they were troubled neither by the forests which elsewhere covered everything, nor by the beasts which threatened every settlement from the shelter of these forests, and so they were able to quickly multiply in number and did not lose the knowledge of their first inventions. The highest antiquity of these three peoples and their resemblance in so many respects shows their common origin and the uncommon exactitude of sacred history. The condition of the other peoples was very different from that of those who stopped early in the rich regions of the Euphrates, Kian and the Nile. Let us imagine elsewhere nomadic families who knew neither places nor roads, and who, finding themselves by chance in a barren land in which they lacked everything, including instruments to practice the good skills which they might have conserved, and the stability or leisure necessary to perfect whatever their current needs might have led them to invent; their modest means of subsistence would put them often at odds, and their mutual jealousy destroy them. Not being more than a handful in number, another group would make them flee. This wandering and often uncertain life led them to forget everything; it is only in reestablishing commerce with the Orient that things changed. The Goths and the entire north only ceased to be barbarians by settling in Gaul and Italy; the Gauls and Franks got their civility from the Romans, who in turn had taken their laws and literature from Athens. Greece remained barbarian until the arrival of Cadmus, who brought the Phoenician alphabet there. The Greeks, enchanted with this tool, became engaged in the cultivation of their language , in poetry and song; yet they lacked a taste for politics, architecture, navigation, astronomy, and painting, until after their journeys to Memphis, Tyr, and the heart of Persia; they perfected everything, but invented nothing. It is thus equally as clear in profane history as in Scriptural narrative that the Orient is the common origin of the nations and of beautiful knowledge. We do not see a reversal until later periods when the thirst for conquests begins to drive bands of Westerners back into Asia.”</p>
		<p> It would perhaps be satisfying to our curiosity to be able to determine what the changes were that Babel introduced into the first language , as well as how they were carried out. It is certain that one cannot establish anything definitive here, since this great revolution in language can only be seen as a miracle that men were truly unable to anticipate. Consequently, there could have been no observer who had his eyes set on this phenomenon, and since it was sudden, it probably would not have permitted of any observations even if one had thought to do so, even as nothing provides as much instruction concerning nature and the progress of things as memories formed in the period directly after observation. Nonetheless, some writers have given their opinions on it with as much confidence as if they had spoken after the event itself or had attended a summit with the Almighty.</p>
		<p> Some say that the division of languages did not occur suddenly, but that it took place imperceptibly in accordance with the constant principles of the natural mutability of language , and that it first became apparent during the construction of the city and the tower of Babel, which in Eusebius’s rapport in Chronicle lasted forty years. The progress of this mutation was at this time found to be so considerable that there was no longer any means to sustain the mutual intelligibility necessary for an enterprise that went directly against God's will, and so men were obliged to separate themselves. See the introduction of the Histoire des juifs et des peuples voisins (H. Prideaux) by Samuel Shucford, book II. Yet this speculation contradicts too formally the text of Scripture and moreover supposes as natural a thing that is belied by ordinary natural effects.</p>
		<p> Chapter 11 of Genesis starts by observing that only one language was spoken everywhere on earth, and that it was spoken in the same way: Erat autem terra labii unicus & sermonum corumdem  [9]; which seems to mean that it was characterized by the same pronunciation, labii unicus  [10], and the same syntax, analogies and expressions, sermonum eorumdem  [11] (v.1). After this fundamental observation, which was envisaged as such by the sacred historian, he speaks of the arrival of Noah’s descendants on the lowlands of Sennahar, their project of constructing a town there and a tower to serve as a signal for them, as well as the materials that they used for this construction. He even insinuates that the work was quite advanced, and then after having remarked that the Lord came down to view it, he adds: & dixit (Dominus): Ecce unus est populus & Unum Labium omnibus: coeperuntque hoc facere, nec desistent à cogitationibus suis, donec eas opere compleant. Venite igitur, descendamus, & confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non audiat unusquisque vocem proximi sui  [12] (v. 67). Is it not clear that only one language existed until the moment when God wanted to put an end to their undertaking, unum labium omnibus ? [13] That as soon as he made his decision, his almighty will executed it, atque ita divisit eos Dominus, v. 8?  [14] That the means he used to accomplish this was the division of the common language , confundamus . . . linguam eorum , [15] and that this caused a sudden confusion, confundamus ibi? [16]</p>
		<p> If this confusion of the first language was not sudden, how could it have impressed men to the point of noting it in an enduring monument, such as the name that was given to this city itself, Babel (confusion)? Et idcirco vocatum est nomen ejus Babel, quia ibi confusum est labium universae terrae [17] (v. 9). How, after having worked for several years in mutual understanding, despite the imperceptible changes that were introduced in their language , were these men all of a sudden forced to separate themselves due to their inability to understand one another? If the progress of the division of their language was still imperceptible the previous day, it should also have been so the following day; or in other words, if there was an extraordinary revolution the following day that was no longer connected to the advances of the preceding alterations, these advances should not be counted as one of the reasons for this revolution; both its cause and its effect should be viewed as sudden and miraculous.</p>
		<p> Yet it is necessary to accept this account, since it is certain that the natural advance of the changes that occur in languages does not create and can never create confusion among those men who originally spoke the same one. If an individual changes common usage, his utterance is first regarded as an error, but either it is understood or he is asked to explain it; in either case, one reminds him of the rule established by usage, or at least one reminds oneself of it. If this particular error, through one of the accidental causes that modify languages, passes from mouth to mouth and is repeated, it ceases in the end to be an error and acquires the authority of usage, it becomes proper to the very language that previously condemned it; but here again we will be understood, since we repeat ourselves. It is in this way that we understand the writers of the previous century, only perceiving between them and us slight differences that cause no confusion. Similarly, they understood those of the previous century who were in the same situation in respect to the writers of the century before them, and so on, back to the time of Charlemagne, to Clovis if you will, or even further back to the most ancient Druids, whom we no longer understand. Yet if the human lifespan was so long that some Druids were still alive today, whether the language underwent the changes that it did or whether it did not, mutual understanding would still be present between them and us, since they would have been forced to adopt the floods of decisions concerning usage of the different centuries. It is thus a complete illusion to want to explain an event by natural causes that can be nothing but miraculous.</p>
		<p> Other authors, convinced that there was no ascribable natural cause, wanted to explain in what consisted the surprising revolution that caused men to abandon the construction of Babel. ‘In my opinion,’ said du Tremblay, ‘God then arranged the organs of these men in such a way that when they wanted to pronounce the words that they were accustomed to use, they uttered completely different words to signify the things about which they wanted to speak. In such a way that those whom God wanted to change their language formed completely new words by articulating their voices in a different way than they were accustomed to doing. And by continuing to articulate their voices in this new way every time they spoke, they constructed a new language , since all their ideas were connected to the terms of this new language instead of being connected to those of the previous one. There is even reason to believe that they so forgot their ancient language that they did not even remember having spoken it, and that they only perceived the change in it for the reason that they could not understand themselves as before. This is how I think the change came about. Supposing the power of God over his creation, I do not see a great mystery in all this nor why the rabbis torment themselves so much to find the manner of this change’ (Traité des langues, ch. vi).</p>
		<p> This is still however to use one’s own imagination in the place of reasons; the division of languages could have occurred in so many different ways that it is not possible to determine a single one with certainty, as if it were to be exclusively preferred to all the others. God might have let the same root words with the same meanings remain but inspired different declensions and constructions; he might have substituted in men's minds other ideas for those that were previously designated by the same words, or he might have altered only pronunciation by changing vowels or substituting homogenous consonants one for another, etc. Who dares determine the way that it pleased Providence to choose, or assert that it did not simultaneously choose multiple ones? Quis enim cognovit sensum Domini, aut quis conciliarius ejus fuit?  [18] (Romans 2:34).</p>
		<p> Let us stick to the facts that are told us by the Holy Spirit; we cannot doubt that it was he himself who inspired Moses. Moreover, all further examination confirms his story: the spectacle of nature, that of society and of the revolutions that have successively changed the scene of the world, and reasoning founded on the best-established observations: in a word, everything supports the same truths, and these are the only ones that we can affirm with certainty, as well as the consequences that flow logically from them.</p>
		<p> God made men social beings; he inspired in them the use of the first language as the instrument to communicate their ideas, needs, and reciprocal obligations, and to be the bond of their society, and, above all, of the exchange of charity and kindness which he makes the indispensable foundation of this society.</p>
		<p> When he then wanted to use their fruitfulness to cover and cultivate the different corners of the world that he had subjected to the domain of this species, and when he saw them take measures to resist their calling and their impenetrable views of his providence, he confused the first language and thus forced them to separate themselves into as many peoples as there were languages , and to disperse themselves in an equal number of different regions.</p>
		<p> Such is the fact of the first division of languages ; and the only thing that I consider reasonable to add to it is that God made sudden changes in the first language analogous to those that natural causes subsequently would have established if men had dispersed in various colonies in various regions of the earth by their own movements. Even in terms of the events that occur outside the natural order, God does not act against nature, since he cannot act against his eternal and immutable ideas, which are the archetypes of all natures. However, this gives rise to an objection that merits examination. It follows here:</p>
		<p> First, that the Creator gave the first man and his companion the inspiration for the first of all languages to use as the bond and instrument of the society that it pleased him to establish between them; that education, supported by their natural curiosity and by the inclination that men have toward imitation, passed this language from generation to generation, and thus that the original link between the descendants of Adam and Eve was maintained for as long as this language subsisted on its own, is a first point that is easy to conceive and that is necessary to admit.</p>
		<p> Next, that men, too enamored of the sweetness of this society, had wanted to elude the intention and the orders of the Creator who had destined them to populate all the corners of the world; and that to force them, God had judged it necessary to confuse their language and to multiply its idioms, in order to relax the bond that had them too attached to one another; this is a second and equally attested point, which our understanding does not have any greater difficulty in grasping when one considers it separately.</p>
		<p> Nonetheless, the combination of these two facts seems to create a real difficulty. If the confusion of languages divided peoples, is this not contrary to the first intention of the Creator and the happiness of humanity? To dissipate what is specious in this objection, it is not sufficient to consider in only a vague and indefinite way the affection that everybody should have for his fellow man, and the germ of which lies within him. This affection has naturally, that is to say as a necessary consequence of the laws that the Creator himself has established, different degrees of intensity in accordance with the strength of the connection that exists between one man and another. Similar to how the circular waves that form around a stone when it is thrown in water are less intense in proportion to the extent that they move away from the center of the wave, the more the links between men are weakened by the distance of time, place, generation, and of different interests, the less there is liveliness in their respective feelings of natural kindness, although it still always subsists even with the greatest distance. But far from being contrary to this proportional distribution of kindness the division of languages is in some ways in the same proportion, and thus it is adapted, so to speak, to the designs of universal charity: if one places its degrees in parallel with the differences in languages , the more the comparison is exact, the more one will become convinced that one of the them is the correct measure for the other. This will be made clearer in the following article.</p>
		<p> Article III. Analysis and Comparison of Languages. All languages have the same goal, the enunciation of thoughts. To attain it they all use the same instrument, the voice; these are like the spirit and body of language . Furthermore, up to a certain point, the same holds for languages thus considered as for the men who speak them.</p>
		<p> All human souls, if we are to believe the Cartesian school, are absolutely of the same kind and nature; they have the same faculties in the same degree, the seeds of the same talents, mind, and genius, and between them there are only quantitative or individual differences. Moreover these differences are determined by exterior causes; the intimate organization of the bodies that they animate; the various temperaments that conditions establish in them; the greater or lesser frequency and favorability of the occasions which can incite ideas in them, bring them together, combine them, and develop them; the more or less fortunate prejudices that they receive through education, customs, religion, political government, domestic relations, civil and national ones, etc.</p>
		<p> It is more or less the same with respect to the human body. Formed out of the same material if one considers its principal elements it seems, so to speak, cast from the same mold, even if it has perhaps never yet been the case that a single man has born an exact bodily resemblance to another individual. Whatever the physical connection between any two men, as soon as there is a group of individuals there are more or less perceptible differences of appearance other than those that are inside the bodily machine; these differences are all the more marked in proportion to the diminution of causes that produce converging effects. Thus, all the subjects of a nation have individual differences among themselves but also display traits of national resemblance. The national resemblance of a people is not the same as the national resemblance of another neighboring people, even if they share similar characteristics. These characteristics weaken and different traits increase progressively as the terms of comparison become more remote, up to the point at which the enormous diversity of climates and of the other causes that more or less depend on it leave only in place the traits that permit us to identify individuals as members of the same species, notwithstanding the sharp differences between Whites, Blacks, the Lapps and the southern Europeans.</p>
		<p> Let us distinguish in the same way between the mind and the body of languages , the common object that they propose and the universal instrument that they use to express it, or in a word, between the thoughts and the articulated sounds of the voice. We will unravel from this distinction that which they necessarily have in common and that which they have as unique with respect to both these points of view, and we will put ourselves in a position to establish reasonable principles as to the generation of languages , their mixture, their affinity and their respective merit.</p>
		<p> I. I have already said elsewhere (See Grammar and Inversion) that the human mind manages to distinguish parts in its thought, completely indivisible as it is, by separating via abstraction the different ideas that make up its object and the various relations that they have among themselves due to the connection that they all share to this indivisible thought by which they are envisaged. This analysis, whose principles derive from the nature of the human mind and which is the same everywhere, should reveal everywhere the same results, or at least similar results, envisage ideas in the same way, and establish the same classification of words.</p>
		<p> There are thus in all languages words destined to express the beings, both real and abstract, whose ideas can be the objects of our thoughts, and words destined to designate the general relations between these beings. Words of the first kind are indeclinable [19]; that is to say, they permit various inflections in light of the goals of the analysis, which can envisage the same beings under various aspects and in various circumstances. The words of the second kind are indeclinable because they always present the same idea under the same aspect.</p>
		<p> Declinable words always have a defined meaning or an undefined meaning. Those of the first kind present the mind with determinate beings and are of two kinds; nouns, which determine beings in terms of their nature; and pronouns, which determine them by their personal relations. Those of the second kind present the mind with indeterminate beings. They are also of two kinds; adjectives, which designate them in terms of the precise idea of a quality or of a particular relationship that can be attributed to several beings, and of which it is either an essential or accidental part; and verbs, which designate them by a precise idea of intellectual existence with respect to a quality that can also be attributed to several beings.</p>
		<p> Indeclinable words are universally divided into three kinds: prepositions, adverbs and conjunctions; prepositions designate general relations by means of abstract terms; adverbs designate particular relations to a determined term; and conjunctions designate the links between the various parts of discourse. See Word and the different kinds defined there.</p>
		<p> I will not address interjections here, since this kind of word does not concern the enunciation of the mind's thoughts but the indication of the soul’s feelings; interjections are not arbitrary instruments of the art of speaking, but natural signs of sensibility that are prior to all that which is arbitrary, and so little dependent on the art of speaking and languages that even those born mute do not lack them.</p>
		<p> As for the relations that arise between partial ideas and for the general connection that they all have to one same indivisible thought, I believe that these relations presuppose a fixed order between their terms: the prior condition comes first and the consequence necessarily comes afterward. As a result, between the partial ideas of the same thought, there is a succession based on their relations and which results from the connection that they all have to this thought. See [Inversion]. I give this succession the name analytical order , since it is simultaneously the result of the analysis of thought and the foundation of the analysis of speech, in whichever language it is enunciated.</p>
		<p> As everyone agrees, speech must indeed be the sensible image of thought; but every sensible image presupposes in its model parts, an order, and a proportion among these parts. Only the analysis of thought can therefore be the natural and immediate object of the sensible image which speech must produce in every language ; moreover, only the analytical order can regulate the order and proportion of this successive and fleeting image. This rule is certain since it is as unchanging as the nature of the human mind which is its source and principle. Its influence on all languages is as necessary as it is universal; without this original and invariable prototype, there could be no communication among people from different centuries, nor among people of different regions of the world, and not even between any two individuals, since they would not have a single immutable term of comparison to which to relate their respective ways of communicating.</p>
		<p> But by means of this common term of comparison, communication is generally established everywhere, with only the difficulties that spring from the different ways of painting the same object. People who speak the same language understand one another since they paint the same original in the same way and with the same colors. Two neighboring people, such as the French and Italians, who more or less follow similar rules of syntax although with different words, manage to easily understand each other’s language , because once again they both paint the same original and more or less with the same perspective although with different colors. Two people who are further apart and whose vocabulary and constructions completely differ, such as the French and the Latins, for example, can still mutually understand one another, although perhaps with slightly more difficulty. The reason remains the same: the former and the latter paint the same original object, but it is drawn and painted differently.</p>
		<p> The analytical order is therefore the universal basis of the communicability of all languages and the exchange of thoughts, which is the soul of society; it is thus the term to which one must reduce all the sentences of a foreign language in the understanding of which one wants to make any certain, reasoned and thorough progress. The rest is, so to speak, but a matter of memory, in which it is only a question of absorbing the arbitrary conventions of good usage. This consequence, which the following reflections will only confirm and develop further, is the true foundation of the practical method that I propose elsewhere (in the article [Method]) for the Latin language, which is the first object of public and ordinary instruction in Europe. This method, because of the universality of its principle, can with similar success be applied to all foreign languages , dead and alive, that one might consider studying or teaching.</p>
		<p> So this is thus what is found universally in the spirit of every language ; the analytical succession of partial ideas that jointly constitute the same thought, and the same kinds of words to represent these partial ideas envisaged under the same aspects. But with respect to these two general objects, these languages admit of all the differences that derive from the particular spirit of the people who speak them, and who are themselves simultaneously the principal agents of the spirit of these languages and the principal source of the difficulties that arise in translating word-by-word from one to the other.</p>
		<p> 1°. In relation to the analytical order, there are two means by which it can be made sensible in the vocal enunciation of thought. The first is to arrange the words in the enunciation according to the same order that results from the analytical succession of partial ideas; the second is to give declinable words inflexions or endings that pertain to the analytical order and then to regulate their arrangement in the enunciation by means of other principles that are capable of adding to the perfection of the art of speaking. Hence the most universal division of languages into the two different kinds that Abbot Girard called analogous and transpositive , and which I will refer to with the same names, since it seems to me that they characterize well their distinctive spirit (Les vrais principes de la langue françoise tom. I, p. 23.).</p>
		<p> The analogous languages are those whose syntax is subject to the analytical order since the succession of words in speech follows the analytical gradation of ideas; the syntax of these languages is thus in effect analogous and in some way parallel to that of the mind, whose operations it follows step-by-step.</p>
		<p> The transpositive languages are those that attribute to words endings which are relative to the analytical order, and which in so doing acquire the right to arrange these words freely in speech, in an syntax that is completely independent of the natural succession of ideas. French, Italian and Spanish are analogous languages ; Greek, Latin, German, etc., are transpositive languages .</p>
		<p> Moreover, this first distinction of languages is not founded on exclusive properties; it only indicates the most ordinary way to proceed, since analogous languages may admit of slight inversions that are easy to bring back to the natural order, just as transpositive languages sometimes adhere to the analytical order or come more or less close to it. Relatively frequently the need for clarity, which is the most essential quality of any enunciation, gets the upper hand over the spirit of analogous languages and diverts them from the analytical path as soon as it stops being the most lucid one. The transpositive languages , on the contrary, at times subscribe to the analytical order for the same reason and at other times either to follow the impressions of taste or the laws of harmony. Nonetheless in both types of languages words bear the stamp of their characteristic spirit; nouns, pronouns and adjectives, all naturally declinable, are always declined in the transpositive languages in order to permit all the usual inversions without making the fundamental traits of the analytical succession disappear. In the analogous languages , these same kinds of words are not declined since they must always follow the analytical order or stray from it so little that it is always recognizable.</p>
		<p> The German language is transpositive and it has declinations; however, its syntax is not as free as it seems to have been in Greek and Latin, in which each speaker determined it according to his ear or particular taste; instead, here usage has determined all its constructions. In a simple and absolute proposition, the usual construction follows the analytical order: die creaturen aussern ihre thatlichkeit entweder durch bewegung, oder durch gedancken (the creatures express their activity either by movement or thought). There are only a few cases where one abandons the analytical order to make the sentence clearer or more expressive. It is for the same reason that the verb is positioned at the end in accidental clauses; das wesen welches in uns dencket (the being which in us thinks); unter denen digen die moeglich sind (among the things that possible are). All the other inversions used in German follow the same structure; they are determined this way by usage and it would be a barbarism to substitute for them another type of inversion or even the analytic construction.</p>
		<p> This observation, which initially could have been considered only an hors d'oeuvre , gives rise to a general consequence; that is, with respect to the construction of words, transpositive languages can be divided into two classes. The transpositive languages of the first class are free because the construction of the phrase depends, more or less, on the choice of the speaker, on what sounds good to him and his particular taste, which may vary for the same enunciation according to the various circumstances in which it is produced; such is the Latin language . The transpositive languages of the second class are uniform because the construction of the phrase is constantly regulated by usage which has left no room for taste or what sounds better to the speaker; such is the German language .</p>
		<p> What I have called attention to for the first division is also applicable to the second, and although the distinctive characteristics that we assign to them are sufficient to determine the two classes, we still sometimes find some traits in one that belong to the essence of the other. The free transpositive languages may have certain perpetually fixed constructions, and the uniform ones can in some instances regulate their syntax arbitrarily.</p>
		<p> A quite natural question thus presents itself. The analytical and transpositive orders of words presuppose completely different perspectives in the languages that have adopted them to regulate their syntax; each of these two orders reflects a different essence. But since there was originally only one language on earth, is it possible to determine of which kind it was, that is, whether it was analogous or transpositive?</p>
		<p> The analytical order being the invariable prototype of the two general kinds of language and the unique foundation of their respective communicability, it seems quite natural that the first language was scrupulously attached to it and that it subordinated the order of words to it, rather than having imagined endings relative to this order only to later abandon them without further ado. It is evident that there is less complexity in the analogous language than in the transpositive one, and all human institutions have simple beginnings. This conclusion, which seems to me to be solidly founded on the first principles of language , is further supported by what we know of the history of the different languages of which we have made use on earth.</p>
		<p> The Hebrew language , which is the oldest we know because of the examples that have survived up to our day, and which consequently seems to be the closest to the first language , is regulated by an analogous syntax. This is even an argument that could have served those who think that Hebrew is the first language . It is not that I think that we can base anything certain on this, but if this observation is not conclusive enough to settle the question, at least it proves that the analytical construction, followed by the most ancient language of which we have knowledge, may well have been the common construction of the first of all languages, thus conforming to what is also demonstrated to us by reason itself.</p>
		<p> From this it follows that the modern languages of Europe that have adopted the analytical construction are notably more closely related to the original language than are Greek and Latin, although they are much more distant from it in time. Jean-Baptiste Bullet, in his extensive and knowledgeable work on the Celtic language , has found many connections between this language and the oriental ones, notably Hebrew. D. le Pelletier shows us similar analogies in his dictionary of low Breton, whose publication and preface we owe to D. Taillandier. All these analogies are strictly material and consist of a great number of common roots for the two languages . On the other hand, however, in his Discours historique sur l’origine de la langue Françoise, de Grandval, counselor to the council of Artois and of the literary society of Arras, seems to me to have adequately proven that today’s French is nothing more than the Gallic of the old Druids, imperceptibly disguised by all the changes that the succession of centuries necessarily bring about and the interaction of circumstances that varies without end (see the second volume of the Mercure de France from June and the volume from July 1757). Yet this Gallic was certainly either a pure Celtic language or a dialect of Celtic, and we must say the same of the idiom of the ancient Spaniards, of that of Albion, which is today Great Britain, and perhaps many more. Hence our modern language, Spanish and English , linked by Celtic to Hebrew. This connection, established by the analogous construction that characterizes all these languages , is in my view a much surer indicator of their filiation than all the imaginable etymologies that connect them to the transpositive languages , since it is above all in syntax that the principal and indestructible essence of all languages lies.</p>
		<p> The Italian language , which is an analogous language and which is today spoken in a country where a transpositive language was spoken a few centuries ago, i.e. Latin, can give rise to an objection against the principal proof of de Grandval. De Grandval has judged that the language of a nation should always subsist, at least with respect to its sounds, and that we should not admit of negative arguments in similar cases, especially for a great nation that has never suffered from transmigrations; and history does not appear to inform us that the Italians had ever sent colonies sufficiently ample in number to depopulate their homeland.</p>
		<p> Yet the shift of the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium attracted a great number of ambitious families and imperceptibly the principal forces of Italy to this new capital. The frequent invasions of all kinds of Barbarians, who successively flooded and established their dominion in this place, steadily decreased the number of locals. The despotism of most of these conquerors finally managed to impose on the populace, who despite their fury they had not deigned to destroy, the necessity to speak the language of the victors. Most of these Barbarians spoke a dialect of Celtic, which was the most common langage in all of Europe, and it is moreover a known fact that the Gauls themselves conquered and inhabited a large part of Italy, which received the name Cisalpine Gaul. The modern Italian language is thus still grafted on the same foundations as ours; yet with the difference that this foundation is natural to us, and that it only underwent in our hands the changes brought inevitably by the ordinary succession of time and events. In Italy, however, it was a foreign foundation that was only introduced there by exceptional and violent causes. This matter is so unlikely in any other way that, supposing the analogous construction employed by the original language , it is no longer possible to explain the origin of the transpositive languages without going back to the miraculous division that occurred in Babel. Moreover this observation, elaborated as much as possible, can be included among the grounds for belief in the certainty of this miracle.</p>
		<p> 2°. With regard to the different kinds of words, a similar specific idea characterizes them in all languages since this idea is the necessary result of the analysis of thought which is necessarily everywhere the same. However, in the examination of individual cases we encounter differences that are the necessary results of the circumstances in which the peoples who speak these languages found themselves, and these differences make up a second distinct characteristic of the essence of languages .</p>
		<p> The first manner in which they differ in this regard is that certain ideas are not expressed by any term in one language , although they have distinct and very emphatic signs in another. This is because the nation that speaks one of these languages has not found itself in the circumstances necessary to bring about these ideas while the other nation, on the contrary, has had the occasion to acquire such knowledge. How many terms there are, for example, pertaining to the tactics of the Ancients, whether Greek or Roman, which we cannot translate in our own since we ignore their usage? We supplement for them as best we can with descriptions that are always imperfect, or, if we want to express these ideas by a single term, we materially borrow it from the ancient language in question while attaching to it the incomplete notions that we have of it. How many terms, on the contrary, do we have today in our language that it would not have been possible to translate into Greek or in Latin, since our modern ideas were unfamiliar to them? Our vast progress in the sciences of reasoning, calculus, geometry, mechanics, astronomy, metaphysics, experimental physics, natural history, etc., have given our modern idioms a wealth of expressions that those of the Ancients could not even begin to express. Add the terms of glass-making, hunting, sea-faring, business, wars, fashions, religions, etc., to this and you will have a vast source of differences between modern and ancient languages .</p>
		<p> A second difference of languages in respect to the different kinds of words comes from the distinctive attitude of the national spirit of each of them, whose effect is that the same ideas are envisaged in different ways. This point calls for further development. It is necessary to point out two kinds of constitutive ideas in the meaning of words, specific ideas and individual ideas. By the specific idea of the meaning of words, I mean the general point of view that determines each word class, that makes a word belong to a class of one kind rather than another, that consequently suits each of the words of the same word class and exclusively those of this word class. It is the difference between these general points of views, between these specific ideas, that lays the foundation of what Grammarians call parts of oration : nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, adverbs, conjunctions and interjections. It is moreover the difference between the secondary points of view of which each specific idea is also susceptible, that serves as the foundation for the subdivision of a part of oration into its subordinate kinds, for example nouns into common and abstract nouns, proper nouns and appellatives, etc. See Noun. By the individual idea of the meaning of words, I mean the particular idea that characterizes the proper meaning of each word and that distinguishes it from all the other words of the same class, since it cannot apply to more than one word of the same class. It is thus to the difference between these particular ideas that pertains that of the individual parts of an oration, or that of each subordinate class of each part of the oration. Furthermore, it is on the difference between the secondary ideas of which each individual idea is susceptible that depends the difference between the words of the same class that we call synonyms ; for example, in French, the nouns poverty, indigence, scarcity, need, necessity; the adjectives, cunning, bad, evil, roguish ; the verbs, to aid, to help, to assist , etc. See on all these words Synonymes français by Abbot Girard; and for the general theory of synonyms, the article Synonyms . We feel strongly that it is necessary to distinguish the primary idea and the secondary idea in each individual idea. The primary idea can be common to several words of the same word class, which are thus different with respect to the secondary idea. Yet it is precisely here that we find a second source of differences among the words of various languages. A primary idea may enter into the individual idea of two words of the same word class, belonging to two different languages, without these two words being strictly synonymous with each other. In one of these two languages , this primary idea alone may comprise the individual idea, although it be combined with a secondary idea in the other language ; or else it might be combined with one secondary idea in the first language and another quite different secondary idea in the other. The adjective vacuus [vacant, void], for example, has a very general meaning in Latin that was later determined by the various ways in which it was used; in French, there is no one adjective that exactly corresponds to it. The various adjectives which we make use of to express the Latin vacuus add to the general idea that makes up its individual meaning several secondary ideas that required in Latin particular uses and complements; add [20]: Gladius vaginâ vacuus , a naked blade, vagina ense vacua , an empty sheath, vacuus animus , a free spirit, etc. See Hypallage. This second difference of languages is one of the great obstacles that we encounter in translation, and one of the most difficult ones to overcome without altering something in the original text. It is also the reason that we have up until now been so little successful in developing good dictionaries, whether for dead languages or living ones. We have not sufficiently analyzed the different partial ideas, whether primary or secondary, that usage has attached to the meaning of each word. We should not be surprised; this analysis not only requires sound logic and great ingenuity, but also extensive study, an enormous quantity of textual comparisons, and consequently an extraordinary braveness and confidence, and with respect to the glory of success, a disinterestedness that is as rare as it is difficult to find in men of letters – even the most modest ones. See Dictionary.</p>
		<p> §. Il. If languages have both common properties and differences based on the way that they envisage the thought that they desire to express, we find similarly, in the usage that they make of the voice, procedures that are common to all idioms, and others which serve to complete the characteristics that mark the distinctive spirit of each of them. Thus, as languages all differ in how they represent the common model that they all serve to paint, namely thought, they also differ as to the choice, mixture and tone of colors that they can employ, namely the articulated sounds of the voice. Let us take a further look at languages considered from this double point of view, namely their resemblances and differences with respect to the materiality of their sounds. The essay manuscript by Charles de Brosses will serve here as our primary resource.</p>
		<p> 1°. A first class of words that we can consider natural, since they are found at least more or less the same in all languages and must have been part of the system of the first language , are interjections: necessary effects of the relationship established by nature between certain feelings of the soul and certain organic parts of the voice. See Interjection. These are the first, most ancient and most original words of the first language ; they are invariable amid the perpetual variations of languages , since, as a result of the physical form of human beings, they have a physical connection that is both necessary and indestructible with the interior feelings that they express. To the interjections and in the same class we can add accents, a kind of song connected to speech, and which receives from them greater life and activity. This is well marked by the Latin word accentus [derived from accanere, to sing] , which we have borrowed directly into French. Accents are the real soul of words, or rather, they are to speech what the stroke of the bow and expression are to music. They mark its spirit, they give it its flavor; that is to say, an air of conformity to truth, and it is without doubt for this reason that the Hebrews gave them a name that means taste , flavor. They are the foundation of all oral declamation, and we know well enough how much superiority they give to oral over written discourse, because whereas speech paints objects, accents paint the way in which the speaker is affected by them or wants others to be so affected. Accents derive from the sensibility of the body and this is the reason why they are found in all languages , although to varying degrees, depending on the extent to which the climate makes a nation susceptible, due to its bodily disposition, to being strongly affected by exterior objects. The Italian language , for example, is more accented than ours; their simple speech as well as their music is much more vocal. They are hence subject to becoming more passionate; nature has given them a much more sensitive nature. Exterior objects move them so strongly that is not even enough for the voice to express all that they feel; they add gestures to it and speak with their entire body at the same time.</p>
		<p> A second class of words, in which all languages still exhibit common analogies and marked similarities, is baby talk, determined by the more or less great mobility of each organic part of the vocal instrument in combination with inner needs or the need to name exterior objects. Whatever the country, the easiest movement is to open the mouth and move one’s lips, which gives the most open sound a , and one of the labial sounds , b, p, v, s or m. From this it follows that the syllables ab , pa , am , ma are the first that are pronounced by children in all languages ; hence papa, maman, and others related to these. It appears likely that children would form these sounds themselves at the first moment in which they were able to articulate, if their nurses, foreclosing an experiment which would be extremely interesting to carry out, did not teach them in advance; or rather, children were the first to stutter them, and their parents – eager to establish an exchange of love with them – repeated the syllables with indulgence and consequently established them in all languages, even the most ancient ones. Indeed, one finds them there with the same meaning, but disfigured by the endings that the distinctive spirit of each language has added to them, in such a manner that the most ancient language s have conserved them in a state that is more natural, or closer to nature. In Hebrew ab , in Chaldean abba , in Greek, ἄππα, πάππα, πατὴρ , in Latin pater , in French papa and père , on the islands of the West Indies baba , among the Hottentots bo ; everywhere it is the same idea marked by the labial sound. Likewise, in the Egyptian language am, ama, and in the Syrian language aminis correspond exactly to the Latin parens (father or mother); hence mamma (breast), the French words, maman, mère, etc. Ammon , the Egyptian God, is the sun and thus named like the father of nature; the figures and statues erected in honor of the sun were named ammanim , and the sacred hieroglyphs used by priests, Ammonian letters. The worship of the sun, adopted by almost all oriental peoples, has consecrated the radical word am, pronounced, depending on the different dialects, ammon, oman, omin, iman , etc. For the Orientals, Iman means God or Sacred Being, while the Turks today use it to mean priesthood , and ar-iman means Deus fortis [mighty God] for the ancient Persians. ‘The words abba, or baba, or papa , and mama , which the ancient languages of the Far East seemed to have passed on with slight changes to those in Europe, are common’, said de la Condamine in his report on the Amazon River, ‘to a great number of nations in Southern America where the language is otherwise very different. If we consider these words as the first sounds that children can articulate, and consequently as those whose adoption must everywhere have been preferred by the parents who heard them articulated, in order to use them as signs for the ideas father and mother , what remains to understand is why, in all the languages of America where these words are found, their meaning has been preserved without having been confused. By what chance is it that in the Omogua language , for example, in the continental center, or in another similar language where the words papa and mama are used, it is never the case that papa means mother and vice versa, but that we constantly observe the contrary, just as in the languages of the East and Europe?’ If it is nature that dictates these first words to children, it is also she who invariably attaches the same ideas to them, and we can draw from her breast the explanation of one of these phenomena as readily as that of the other. The great mobility of the lips is the cause that gives rise to the first sounds, the labial articulations and, among these, those that require less force and difficulty in the expression of sound became in a sense the earliest ones, since their production is easier. From this it follows that the syllable ma is anterior to ba , since the articulation m requires less force during its expression and the lips only move slightly and slowly, which causes one part of the sound matter to go back through the nose. Mama is thus anterior to papa in the order in which it is produced, and it only remains to decide which one of the two, the father or the mother, is the first object of the attention and naming of infants; which one of the two is more attached to their person; which one is the most useful and the most necessary for their subsistence; which one lavishes them with the most caresses and gives them the most care; and it will be easy to determine why the meaning of the two words mama and papa is consistent in all languages . If apa and ama , in the Egyptian language, mean indifferently either father or mother, or both, it is the result of some strange cause opposed to nature, a consequence perhaps of the exemplary customs of this people known for being the source and model of all wisdom, or the work of reflection and art that is practically as ancient as nature herself, although it improves itself slowly. Remark that following the principle that we have established here, it is natural to conclude that the various parts of the speech organ will only contribute to the naming of exterior objects in terms of the degree of their mobility. The tongue [21] will only be put into play after the lips; it will first provide the articulations that are produced by the movement of its tip, then those that depend on its root, etc. Anatomy only needs to determine the genealogical order of sounds and articulations, and philosophy the order of objects in relation to our needs; their combined work produces the dictionary of the most natural words, the most necessary to the first language and the most universal today, notwithstanding the diversity of idioms.</p>
		<p> There is a third class of words that should have, and that actually do have in all languages the same roots, since they are also the work of nature and belong to the first kinds of names. These are those that we owe to onomatopoeia, and that are simply imitative words with respect to some aspect of the objects named. I say that it is nature that suggests them, and the proof consists in the fact that the natural and universal response of all children is to designate noisy things themselves by imitating the noise that they make. Without a doubt, they would retain these primitive and natural names if instruction and example, intervening to disguise and rectify nature, or perhaps in fact to deprave it, did not propose arbitrary names, substituted for natural ones by reasoned decisions, or, if you prefer, by the whimsies of usage. See Onomatopoeia.</p>
		<p> Finally there are if not in all languages, at least in most of them, a certain quantity of words grafted onto the same roots and destined either to have the same meaning or an analogous meaning, although these roots do not have any natural foundation, or at least not one that is apparent. These words have passed from one language to another, initially as if from a first language to one of its dialects which, over the course of time, has transmitted them to other languages that stem from it, or otherwise this transmission was the result of a simple borrowing, of the kind of which we see an infinite number of examples in our modern languages . This universal transmission supposes in this case that the named objects are of general necessity; the word sack that we find in all languages must be of this kind.</p>
		<p> 2°. Notwithstanding the combination of so many general causes whose assistance nature seemed to have prepared to induce all of mankind to speak only one language , and whose influence is visible in the various common roots of all the idioms that divide the human race, there exist as many other particular causes which are equally natural, whose impression is so equally irresistible that they have compelled material differences to be introduced into languages , and of which it would perhaps be even more useful to discover the real origin than it is difficult to identify it with certainty.</p>
		<p> Climate, air, places, water, ways of life and food produce considerable variations in the fine structure of the human body. These causes give more strength to certain parts of the body or they weaken others. These variations, undetectable by anatomical studies, can easily be seen by an observant philosopher in the organs used for speech; it is sufficient to note those of which each people makes most use in the words of its language, and the way in which it uses them. One will thus observe that the Hottentots employ the back of the throat, and the English the edge of the lips, in a very great deal of activity. These small observations concerning variations in human bodily structure can sometimes lead to more important ones. The habit of a people to prefer certain sounds or to inflect certain organs rather than others can often be a good indication of the climate and the character of the nation – which in many respect is determined by the climate, just as the spirit of a language is determined by the character of a nation.</p>
		<p> The habitual usage of harsh articulations indicates a savage people without laws. Liquid articulations are, in a nation that uses them frequently, a sign of nobility and refinement, as much of organs as of taste. With much credibility we can attribute to the soft character of the Chinese nation, which is rather well-known, the fact that it does not make use of the harsh articulation r. The Italian language , in which most of the words come from a corruption of Latin, has softened its pronunciation as it has grown older in the same proportion that the people who speak it has lost the vigor of the ancient Romans; but since it was close to the source from which it drew, it is still, of all the modern languages that have drawn from this source along with it, the one that has conserved the most affinity with the ancient one, at least in this respect.</p>
		<p> The Latin language is straightforward, having pure and clear vowels and only a few diphthongs. If this character of Latin gives it a similar essence to that of the Romans – that is to say, suited to strong and manly things – it is on the other hand much less suited than the Greek language , and even less than our own, to things that only demand pleasure and light graces.</p>
		<p> The Greek language is full of diphthongs that make its pronunciation more elongated, sonorous and babbling. The French language , full of diphthongs and soft letters, approaches in this respect more the Greek pronunciation than the Latin one.</p>
		<p> The combination of several words into a single one or the frequent use of compound adjectives marks a nation with much depth, a quick understanding, an impatient temper and strong ideas: such are the Greeks, the English and the Germans.</p>
		<p> As for Spanish, we observe that the words are long, but of beautiful proportions, serious, sonorant and empathetic like the nation that uses them.</p>
		<p> It was after similar observations, or at least after the impression that results from the material differences in the words of each language , that the emperor Charles V said that he would speak French to a friend, francese ad un amico , German to his horse, tedesco al suo cavallo , Italian to his mistress, italiano alla sua signora , Spanish to God, spagnuolo à Dio , and English to the birds, inglese à gli uccelli.</p>
		<p> §. III. What we have just observed concerning the similarities and differences, as much intellectual as material, of the various idioms that variegate, so to speak, the languages of mankind, puts us in a position to discuss the most generally accepted opinions concerning languages . There are two whose discussion can still generate reflections that are all the more useful as they are general; the first concerns the successive generation of languages ; the second concerns their respective value.</p>
		<p> 1°. There is nothing more ordinary than hearing a reference to the mother tongue, said Abbot Girard, ‘a term that the common people use without being well instructed about what this word means, and with respect to which the truly learned have difficulty in providing an explanation that disentangles the shapeless idea from those who use it. It is customary to suppose that there are mother tongues among those that are extant and to enquire as to which they are, to which one does not hesitate to reply in an assertive tone that they are Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Through conjecture or grace, this honor is also conferred on the German language ’ (Les vrais principes de la langue françoise I. tom. I. p. 30.). What is the proof of this for those who do not want to admit that only prejudice has decided their opinion in this regard? They adduce no other proof of the filiation of languages than the etymology of a few words and the victories or institutions of the people that spoke the mother tongue in the country in which the language , which is claimed to be derived from it, is in use. It is thus that Spanish, Italian, and French are considered the daughters of the Latin language : ‘ an ignoras ,’ said Jul. Cés. Scaliger, linguam gallicam, et italicam, et hispanicam linguae latinae abortum esse ? [22] P. Bouhours, who thought the same thing, made of these three languages three sisters, which he characterized as follows: ‘it seems to me that the Spanish language is a proud woman that holds her head high, that is proud of her greatness, and that loves pomp and excess in everything. The Italian language is a coquettish woman, always dressed and made up, and that only wants to please and that takes much pleasure from trifles. The French language is a prudish woman, but a pleasant prude that, entirely wise and modest that she is, has nothing harsh or fierce about her’ (Les entretiens d'Ariste et d’Eugène II).</p>
		<p> The distinctive characters of the spirit of each of these three languages are well described in this allegory, but I believe that it errs when it considers these three as sisters, daughters of the Latin language. ‘When we observe the prodigious remoteness’, continues the Abbot Girard, ‘of the spirit of these languages from that of the Latin language ; when we pay attention to the fact that etymology indicates only the origin of borrowed words and indicates nothing about the anteriority of the language from which the words are borrowed; when we know that subjugated peoples had their own languages ...When, finally, we see with our own eyes today these living languages decorated with an article that they could not have taken from Latin, a language in which articles never existed, and which is diametrically opposed to the transpositive constructions and inflections of ordinary cases of that language , we could never claim, simply on the basis of a few borrowed words, that they are its daughters, or else it is necessary to give them more than one mother. The Greek language might then also lay claim to this honor, and an infinity of words that come neither from Greek or Latin might also lay claim to this honor on behalf of another. I will admit that they have taken a large part of their wealth from it, but I deny that they are accountable to it for their birth. Borrowed words or etymologies are not sufficient to indicate the origin and kinship of a language ; instead, these can be found in its spirit, as we gradually follow their development and their changes. The fortunes of new words and the ease with which the words of one language pass into another, especially when different peoples mix, will always mislead us here, whereas the spirit independent of the body, and consequently less susceptible to alterations and changes, subsists in the midst of the inconstancy of words and preserves the real mark of a language's origin (ibid. p. 27).</p>
		<p> The same academician, a little further on speaking once again about the so-called daughters of Latin, adds with as much eloquence as truth: ‘one should not view the pillaging of Latin that foreign languages carried out as an act of legitimation, nor its remains as a maternal inheritance. If it is sufficient to claim the honor of this rank (the rank of mother tongue) not to have to owe its birth to another and to show that it was established at the dawn of time, there would only be one single mother tongue in our system of creation, and who would be sufficiently bold to dare to gratify one of the languages that we know with this sort of antiquity? If this advantage depends only on dating back to the confusion of Babel, who can produce the authentic and decisive titles necessary to confirm it? Who is capable of putting all the languages of the universe in the correct balance? The most learned hardly know five or six. Where finally can unimpugnable and trustworthy accounts and very solid proofs be found to show that the first languages that immediately followed the flood were those subsequently spoken by the Jews, the Greeks, and the Romans, or that they were among those that are still spoken by men in our century?’</p>
		<p> Hence, if I am not mistaken, the true principles that should direct us in the examination of the birth of languages are founded on the nature of language and on the ways that the Creator himself suggested to us as means to express our thoughts externally.</p>
		<p> We have seen several kinds of words introduced necessarily into all idioms by natural causes whose influence is anterior and superior to our reasoning, conventions and whims; we have observed that in all languages , or at least in many, there can be a certain quantity of analogous or similar words that common causes, although accidental, have introduced there since the birth of these different idioms. For this reason, word analogies can not be a sufficient proof of the filiation among languages , unless we wish to claim that all the modern languages of Europe are daughters and mothers, respectively, of each other, since they are continually occupied with expanding their vocabulary by the incessant exchange that the exchange of ideas or new viewpoints makes indispensable. The word analogies between two languages are only proof of this exchange, when these are not from the category of natural words.</p>
		<p> It is thus necessary to consider the way that words are used to recognize the identity or the difference between the various spirits of languages, and to judge if they have any affinity or not. If they have some in this respect, I will agree that the analogy of words confirms the filiation of these languages, and that one should be recognized as the mother language in respect to the other, just as we observe in the case of the Russian language , the Polish language and the Illyrian language with respect to the Slavonic language from which it is likely that they derive their origin. But if there is no other connection between two languages than the one that arises from word analogies and no other essential resemblance can be found, then they are foreign to one another: such are the Spanish, Italian and French languages with respect to Latin. If we take a great number of words from Latin, we do not derive our syntax from it, our constructions, our grammar, our articles le, la, les , our auxiliary verbs, the indeclinability of our nouns, the usage of personal pronouns in verb conjugations, a multitude of tenses differentiated in our conjugations and undifferentiated in Latin conjugations. Our grammatical processes are irreconcilable with the gerundive, with the uses that the Romans made of the infinitive, with their arbitrary inversions, with their accumulated ellipses, and with their interminable periods.</p>
		<p> Yet if the filiation of languages entails that the derived language has the same syntax and constructions, or in a word, the same essence as the mother language , as well as a marked analogy between the terms of the former and the latter, then how is the birth of languages possible, and what do we mean by a new language ?</p>
		<p> ‘Some have thought’, said de Grandval in his Discours historique – which has already been cited – ‘that we could describe it as such when it has undergone a considerable change; so that, from this perspective, the language of the times of François I should been seen as new with respect to the language of the time of Saint Louis, and similarly with the language that we speak today in respect to the time of François I, even if we recognize in these different eras a common base language , whether due to its words or sentence constructions. From this point of view there is no language that did not successively become new, when compared to itself in its different past ages. Others only qualify as new languages those whose previous form is no longer intelligible, but this still requires some explanation, since people who are little familiarized with the past form of their language do not understand anything while those who have some familiarity with it understand it very well and easily discover in it all the seeds of their modern language . It is therefore only a question of name here, but one that needed to be taken into account in order to determine our ideas. For my part, I say that a language is the same, despite its variations, as long as we can follow its traces and find a great part of its current words and main grammatical points in its original form. Whether I read the Laws of the Twelve Tables, Ennius or Cicero, regardless of whatever differences there are in their language , is it not still Latin? Otherwise one would have to say that the grown man is not the same person as he was in his childhood. I would also add that a language is truly the mother or the source of another when it is the first that has given the second its being, when this derivation was the result of the passage of time, and when the changes that occurred have not erased all of its ancient remnants.’</p>
		<p> These successive changes that insensibly transform one language into another are related to an infinity of causes of which each only has an imperceptible effect, but the sum of these effects, enlarged by time and accumulated in the long run, finally produces a difference that distinguishes two languages despite their common foundation. The ancient and the modern are equally analogous or equally transpositive, but even in this respect they may still differ slightly.</p>
		<p> Even if analogous syntax is their common characteristic, the modern language , by imitating the transpositive language of peoples who have contributed to its formation by their ties of proximity, commerce, religion, politics, conquests, etc., might have taken a few liberties in this regard; it will allow a few inversions that would have been barbarisms in the ancient language . If several languages are derived from a single one, they may be nuanced in some way by the more or less greater alteration of its fundamental character; thus, our French, English, Spanish and Italian, which seem to be descendants of Celtic and to have absorbed its analytic syntax, have nonetheless turned away from it in a proportion that increases following the same order that I have just mentioned these languages . French is the least bold and closest to the original language ; its inversions are rarer, less complicated and less bold; English permits of more discrepancies in this regard; Spanish is the boldest; while in a way Italian only refuses what the formation of its nouns and verbs combined with the indispensable need to be understood have not allowed. These differences have their causes just like all the rest, and they pertain to the diverse relations that each people has had with those whose language had the possibility to make these changes.</p>
		<p> If, on the contrary, the original language and the derived one are formed in such a way that they must follow a transpositive syntax, then the modern language might have contracted something from the constraints of the analogous languages of the nations from which it has drawn the successive alterations to which it owes its birth and constitution. It is thus without doubt that the German language , originally having free transpositions, was finally subjected to all the constraints of the European languages among which it was established, since all allowable inversions are fixed in this language to the extent that any other, which in itself would not be more obscure, or at least not less obscure, is proscribed by usage as depraved and barbaric.</p>
		<p> In both cases, the most marked difference between the older and modern language still concerns its words: some of its ancient words are abolished, verborum vetus interit oetas , [23] since chance circumstances have suggested others, used by other peoples, that seem more energetic, or else the national ear in perfecting itself has corrected the former pronunciation to the point of disfiguring the word in order to give it more harmony (Ars Poetica 61). New words are introduced, et juvenum ritu florent modo nata, vigentque , [24] since new ideas or new combinations of ideas make it necessary and force a recourse to the language of the people to whom one is indebted for these new discoveries (ibid. v. 62.). It is thus that the word compass has been passed to all the peoples who know its usage, and the Italian origin of this word simultaneously proves to whom the universe owes this important discovery that has today become the link between the most distant nations. Finally, words are in perpetual movement, a fact well-known and well expressed by Horace (ibid. v. 70.).</p>
		<p> Multa renascentur qua jàm cecidêre, cadentque</p>
		<p> Quoe nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus</p>
		<p> Quem penès arbitrium est, et jus, et norma loquendi . [25]</p>
		<p> 2°. The question of the respective merit of languages and of the degree of preference to which they can lay claim over their rivals cannot be resolved by any simple and precise decision. There is no language that does not have its merits, and that might not, depending on circumstances, become preferable to all others. In order to establish this judgment on solid ground, it is thus necessary to distinguish between the various circumstances in which we find ourselves, and the different ways in which languages can be envisaged.</p>
		<p> The simple expression of thought is the first goal of speech and the common object of all languages ; it is thus the first way in which they should be considered in order to establish reasonable principles for the matter at hand. Yet it is evident in this respect that there is no language that has all its possible and necessary perfection for the nation that speaks it. A language , as I have already said, is the sum of a nation’s distinctive usages in order to express thoughts by the voice, and these usages determine its words and syntax. Words are signs of ideas, born with them in the way that a nation, formed and distinguished by its language , cannot acquire a new idea without also acquiring a new word that represents it. If it takes this idea from a neighboring people it will also take from it its vocal sign, and at the very most, will only modify its material form to make it analogous to those of its own langage ; instead of pastor , it says pasteur ; instead of embaxada , embassade; instead of batten , battre , etc. However, if it produces this idea itself, it can only be by means of a combination of older signs; and in this way the path is established that leads to the formation of the word that will signify it; puissance is derived from puissant , since the abstract idea is taken from the concrete idea; parasol is composed of parer (to guarantee) and soleil , as the idea of this object is the result of a combination of the separate ideas of a celestial body that emits burning rays, and an obstacle that can ward off its blows. There is thus no known idea in a nation that is not designated by a distinctive word in the language of this nation, and since all new words introduced into it always bear the stamp of the national analogy that is the necessary seal of its naturalization, it is as proper as the ancient words from all syntactical points of view in this language . Each individual that comprises this people find in their language everything necessary to express all the thoughts that they could possibly have, since they can only think in accordance with these known ideas. This is even the most obvious and strongest evidence for the necessity that everybody should study their own language before all others, since the needs of national communication are the most urgent, universal and common.</p>
		<p> If one would like to look beyond the simple enunciation of thought and envisage all that art can draw from the different constitution of languages in order to please the ear, touch the heart and enlighten the mind, it is necessary to consider the procedures employed in their analogous or transpositive constructions. Hebrew and our French follow the analytical order the most scrupulously; Greek and Latin depart from it in a boundless freedom; German, English, Spanish and Italian have found a middle ground between these two extremes since the inversions which are permitted in them are determined in every respect by the same principles as underpin the distinctive spirit of each of these languages . The author of the Lettre sur les sourds et muets , having envisaged languages in this respect, makes the following judgment, ‘the communication of thought being the principal object of language , our language is the most disciplined, the most exact and the most respected; in a word, it is the one that has retained the fewest of those negligences that I would voluntarily term the remains of the stammering of the first centuries’ (page 135). This claim is in accordance with the author’s system of the origin of languages ! But the one that is adopted in this article is quite opposed to it insofar as it suggests that inversions, far from being remains of the stammering of the first centuries, are in contrast the first attempts at an oratory art many centuries after the birth of language . Our language’s resemblance to the analytical syntax of Hebrew gives a degree of credibility that merits some attention to his conjecture, since Hebrew is born close to the first ages. Whatever the case, the author continues as follows: ‘to continue the parallel without bias, I would say that we have gained in having no inversions – or at least not having any that are too bold or too frequent – in clearness, clarity and precision, essential qualities in speech, and that we have lost warmth, eloquence and energy. I would gladly add to this that the didactic and regulated syntax to which our language is subject makes it more appropriate for the sciences; and because of the expressions and inversions of which Greek, Latin, Italian and English permit, they are more advantageous for literature. That we may make the mind speak better than any other people, and therefore common sense would choose the French language, but that the imagination and the passions have a preference for the ancient languages and those of our neighbors. That French should be spoken in high society and in schools of philosophy, but Greek, Latin and English in academic chairs and in the theaters. That our language is the language of truth...and Greek, Latin and the others are the languages of fables and lies. The French language is perfect to instruct, enlighten and convince; Greek, Latin, Italian and English in order to persuade, upset and deceive. Speak Greek, Latin, and Italian to the common people, but speak French to the wise.’ To reduce this judgment to its true value, we need only conclude that transpositive languages find more resources in their character for all the parts of the art of oratory; and that the character of the analogous languages makes them much more suited to the clear and precise exposition of truth, since they follow more scrupulously the analytical syntax of the spirit. All this is self-evident, and the author has tried to say nothing else. Our analytical syntax does not strip us of warmth, eloquence and energy without resource; it only strips us of a means to express them in our speech, just as the transpositive syntax of Latin, for instance, only exposes it to the danger of being less clear, without making a lack of clarity an inevitable necessity. It is in the same letter, on page 239, that I see the proof of the explication that I have just given of this text: ‘Is there any character,’ the author says, ‘that our language has not adopted without success? It is exuberant in Rabelais, naïve in La Fontaine and Brantome, harmonious in Malherbe and Fléchier, sublime in Corneille and Bossuet; what is it not in Boileau, Racine and Voltaire, and a crowd of other writers of verse and prose? Let us not complain: if we know how to use it, our works will be as precious for posterity as the works of the Ancients are for us. In the hands of an ordinary man, Greek, Latin, English and Italian only produce common things, but French produces miracles if written by a man of genius. No matter what their language is, the works of a genius never falter.’</p>
		<p> If we envisage languages as instruments knowledge of which can be used to reach other insights, they each have their merits and the preference of some over the others can only be decided by the nature of our objectives or our needs.</p>
		<p> The Hebrew language and the other oriental languages that are connected to it, like Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, etc., provide infinite resources to Theology through the precise knowledge of the true meaning of the original texts of our holy books. Yet this is not the only advantage that we can expect from studying Hebrew; it is also in the sacred original that one can discover the origins of peoples, languages , idolatry and fables – in a word, the most certain foundations of history and the most reasonable keys to Mythology . One needs only to see the Géographie Sacrée [ Geographiae sacrae ] of Samuel Bochart to form a high opinion of the immense erudition that knowledge of the oriental languages can provide.</p>
		<p> The Greek language is no less useful for Theology, not only because of the original texts of a few of the books of the New Testament, but also because it is the language of the Chrysostomoses, the Basiles, and the Gregories of Nazianzus and a crowd of other priests whose works represent the glory and edification of the Church. Yet in which part of literature is this language not in perpetual use? It provides masters and models in all genres: poetry, eloquence, history, moral philosophy, physics, natural history, medicine, ancient geography, etc. It is with reason that Erasmus states: ‘ Hoc unum expertus, video nullis in litteris nos esse aliquid sine graecitate’  [26] (Epistles book X).</p>
		<p> The Latin language is of an indispensable necessity; it is the language of the Catholic Church and of all other schools of Christendom, as much in Philosophy and Theology as in Jurisprudence and Medicine. It is moreover, and for this same reason, the common language of all the educated people of Europe. We can only hope that perhaps its use will become even more general and widespread so as to facilitate even more the exchange of the respective insights of the various nations that today cultivate the sciences. Of how many excellent works in all genres of knowledge are we deprived because we do not understand the languages in which they are written?</p>
		<p> Until educated people have agreed among themselves on one language of communication to spare themselves respectively the long, tedious and always insufficient study of several foreign languages , they need to have the courage to apply themselves to those that promise the most assistance to them in the kinds of study that they have embraced by taste or due to the needs of their state. The German language has numerous good works on public law, on medicine and all that depends on it, and on natural history, especially metallurgy. The English language has immense riches in respect to mathematics, physics and commerce. The Italian language offers the widest range of beautiful literature and for the study of art and of history; but the French language, despite the denunciations of those who criticize its pedestrian syntax and who reproaches it its monotony, its supposed poverty and its perpetual anomalies, still has masterpieces in almost all genres. What treasures are the dissertations of the French Academy of Sciences and those of the Belles-lettres and Inscriptions ! And if we look at the distinguished writers of our nation, we find philosophers and geometricians of the first order, great metaphysicians, wise and laborious scholars of antiquity, skillful artists, profound legal scholars, poets who have made the French muses the equal of those of the Greeks, sublime and poignant orators, and politicians whose opinions honor humanity. If any other language than Latin is ever to become the common language of the educated people of Europe, the French language should have the honor of this preference. It has already won the approval of all the courts where it is spoken almost as it is in Versailles, and one must not doubt that this universal taste is as much due to the riches of our literature as it is to the influence of our government on the general politics of Europe.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.</p>
		<p> Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in whistling, signed, or braille. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.</p>
		<p> Human language has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.</p>
		<p> Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.</p>
		<p> Definitions</p>
		<p> Main article: Philosophy of language</p>
		<p> The English word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s "tongue, speech, language" through Latin lingua, "language; tongue", and Old French language. The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.</p>
		<p> As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "French". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.</p>
		<p> When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon. These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.</p>
		<p> During the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.</p>
		<p> Mental faculty, organ or instinct</p>
		<p> One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.</p>
		<p> Formal symbolic system</p>
		<p> Another definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.</p>
		<p> Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.</p>
		<p> Tool for communication</p>
		<p> Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.</p>
		<p> This view of language is associated with the study of language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.</p>
		<p> Unique status of human language</p>
		<p> Main articles: Animal language and Great ape language</p>
		<p> Human language is unique in comparison to other forms of communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.</p>
		<p> In contrast, human language is open-ended and productive, meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an almost infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences). Furthermore, the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely arbitrary, so that the system can only be acquired through social interaction. The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically determined.</p>
		<p> Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols, none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.</p>
		<p> Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings. Human language is also unique in having the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "'s lips]") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "]"). Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing uses the tactile modality.</p>
		<p> Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.</p>
		<p> Origin</p>
		<p> Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.</p>
		<p> One prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky. Chomsky proposes that "some random mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain." Though cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."</p>
		<p> Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that:</p>
		<p> Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered ... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.</p>
		<p> Because language emerged in the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.</p>
		<p> It is mostly undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.</p>
		<p> Study</p>
		<p> The study of language, linguistics, has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the Brahmi script. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.</p>
		<p> Subdisciplines</p>
		<p> The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.</p>
		<p> Early history</p>
		<p> The formal study of language is often considered to have started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.</p>
		<p> In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.</p>
		<p> By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).</p>
		<p> Contemporary linguistics</p>
		<p> In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.</p>
		<p> In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.</p>
		<p> Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech</p>
		<p> Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.</p>
		<p> The brain</p>
		<p> The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called neurolinguistics.</p>
		<p> Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which is located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.</p>
		<p> With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.</p>
		<p> Anatomy of speech</p>
		<p> Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract – the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.</p>
		<p> The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.</p>
		<p> Consonants and vowel segments combine to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.</p>
		<p> Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity. Vowels are called close when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel  (English "ee"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel  (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as  (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between  (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and  (rounded front vowel such as German "ü").</p>
		<p> Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English  in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from  in buzz (voiced sibilant).</p>
		<p> Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.</p>
		<p> By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.</p>
		<p> Structure</p>
		<p> When described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.</p>
		<p> Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.</p>
		<p> The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called semantics. The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.</p>
		<p> Semantics</p>
		<p> Main articles: Semantics, Semiotics, and Meaning (linguistics)</p>
		<p> Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.</p>
		<p> Thus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of grammatical categories.</p>
		<p> All languages contain the semantic structure of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "]" or "]". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of pragmatics.</p>
		<p> Sounds and symbols</p>
		<p> Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.</p>
		<p> Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes. Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat  and pat  form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds  and  (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like Korean and Hindi do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin  and the aspirated /p/ in pin  are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words  'crouch' and  'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).</p>
		<p> All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.</p>
		<p> Writing systems represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.</p>
		<p> Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.</p>
		<p> In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.</p>
		<p> Grammar</p>
		<p> Main article: Grammar</p>
		<p> Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.</p>
		<p> Grammatical categories</p>
		<p> Main article: Grammatical category</p>
		<p> Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.</p>
		<p> Word classes</p>
		<p> Languages organize their parts of speech into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called nouns. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called verbs. Another common category is the adjective: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as Korean, the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.</p>
		<p> Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called transitive.</p>
		<p> Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as conjunctions like "and" that serve to join two sentences, articles that introduce a noun, interjections such as "wow!", or ideophones like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:</p>
		<p> san-nin no gakusei (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student" — three students</p>
		<p> For trees, it would be:</p>
		<p> san-bon no ki (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree" — three trees</p>
		<p> Morphology</p>
		<p> In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called morphology. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several morphemes. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".</p>
		<p> Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".</p>
		<p> Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.</p>
		<p> Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"</p>
		<p> Syntax</p>
		<p> Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not. Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning. For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because servos, or "slaves", is in the accusative case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or "master", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.</p>
		<p> Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels. To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.</p>
		<p> The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: " on the mat, the cat sat". There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.</p>
		<p> Typology and universals</p>
		<p> Main articles: Linguistic typology and Linguistic universal</p>
		<p> Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate. For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic word order, the relative order of the verb, and its constituents in a normal indicative sentence. In English, the basic order is SVO: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the Australian language Gamilaraay would be d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy (snake man bit), SOV. Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such correlations are called implicational universals. For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the SOV type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.</p>
		<p> All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. Some languages, called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used. In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.</p>
		<p> The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.</p>
		<p> Social contexts of use and transmission</p>
		<p> While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.</p>
		<p> However, languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.</p>

		<p> The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.</p>
		<p> The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.</p>
		<p> Acquisition</p>
		<p> Main articles: Language acquisition, Second-language acquisition, Second language, and Language education</p>
		<p> All healthy, normally developing human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring sign or oral languages. This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".</p>
		<p> First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age, a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child's first utterances are holophrases (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language. Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.</p>
		<p> Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.</p>
		<p> Culture</p>
		<p> Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists, ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.</p>
		<p> Linguists use the term "varieties" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.</p>
		<p> Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.</p>
		<p> However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law. Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social deixis", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means. In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.</p>
		<p> Writing, literacy and technology</p>
		<p> Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called writing systems.</p>
		<p> The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.</p>
		<p> The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.</p>
		<p> Change</p>
		<p> All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.</p>
		<p> Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *bʰ became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.</p>
		<p> Another example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.</p>
		<p> Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the second person subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun tú. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ¿como te llamas?  in Standard Spanish, but  in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax. Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).</p>
		<p> Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards more common types. Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.</p>
		<p> Contact</p>
		<p> Main article: language contact</p>
		<p> One important source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.</p>
		<p> When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.</p>
		<p> Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.</p>
		<p> Linguistic diversity</p>
		<p> SIL Ethnologue defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and dialects. As of 2016, Ethnologue cataloged 7,097 living human languages. The Ethnologue establishes linguistic groups based on studies of mutual intelligibility, and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the Danish language that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.</p>
		<p> According to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).</p>
		<p> Languages and dialects</p>
		<p> There is no clear distinction between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to linguist Max Weinreich that "a language is a dialect with an army and navy". For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Hakka, Cantonese and Mandarin are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual intelligibility.</p>
		<p> Language families of the world</p>
		<p> The world's languages can be grouped into language families consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.</p>
		<p> The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population. This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD), and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20% of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.</p>
		<p> Africa is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population. A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.</p>
		<p> The Austronesian languages are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania. It includes such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).</p>
		<p> The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America, the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene, Iroquoian, and Algonquian language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas Papua-New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.</p>
		<p> Language endangerment</p>
		<p> Language endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.</p>
		<p> The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.</p>
		<p> The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict, but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.</p>
		<p> Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.</p>`

	eArt: `<p>London, in good Latin, Londinium, (see Londinium) and in modern Latin Londinum , capital of Great Britain, the seat of the monarchy, one of the oldest, grandest, richest, most populated and most flourishing cities of the world. It was already very celebrated for its commerce in the time of Tacitus, copiâ negociatorum ac commeatuum maximè celebre; but Ammianus Marcellinus went further, he drew up the horoscope of its great future: Londinium , he said, vetus oppidum, quod Augustam posteritas adpellabit .</p>
	<p>It merits this title today in all respects. Mr. Voltaire presented it in his 'Henriade' as the center of arts, the shop of the world and the temple of Mars .</p>
	<p>For this well-endowed advantage, it enjoys the great privilege of self-government. It has to this effect, its courts of justice, of which the principal is called the Borough Council; it is a part of the English Parliament, composed of two orders: the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, who represent the Lords' Chamber; and the other Council members, 231 in number, chosen in the different areas of the city, who represent the Borough Chamber. This court alone has the power to honor a foreigner with the rights of the bourgeoisie. It is in this court that the municipal laws are made, which bind all the bourgeoisie, each one having there given their consent, either by themselves, or by their representatives; in ecclesiastical matters, the city is governed by its Bishop, the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
	<p>London contains thirty-five parishes, and in consequence a large number of churches, of which the cathedral called St. Paul's, is the most beautiful building that exists of this type, after St. Peter's of Rome. Its length from east to west is 570 feet; its width from the north to the south, is 311 feet; its dome from the ground floor is about 338 feet in height. The stone of this building, of which construction began in 1667, after the Great Fire, and which was promptly completed, is Portland stone, which lasts nearly as long as marble.</p>
	<p>Non-conformists have in this city about twenty-five assemblies or temples, the number of these that foreign Protestants have for themselves is thirty; and the Jews worship in a beautiful synagogue.</p>
	<p>One counts in London five thousand streets, about a hundred thousand houses, and a million inhabitants.</p>
	<p>This capital, which in the words of English writers, lifts her head above all the commercial world, is the meeting-place of all the ships returning from the Mediterranean, America, and the East Indies. It is she, that after receiving sugars, tobacco, Indians, spices, oils, fruits, wines, cod, andc. spreads these things through the three kingdoms: it is also to her bosom that almost all of the natural produce of Great Britain goes.</p>
	<p>Five hundred enormous ships continually carry coal there; what one judges by this sole point, is the astonishing consumption of other necessary commodities of subsistence in a city so populated. The Mediterranean provinces that surround it, transport on their seas all their merchandise, that which will be consumed, or that which is to embark for foreign countries. Twenty thousand mariners are occupied on the Thames to drive to London , or from London to the provinces, an infinity of things in a thousand different spaces. In a word, it is like a spring that supports England in a continuous movement.</p>
	<p>I do not propose a point of entry here into greater detail on this subject. John Stow fairly immortalized the monuments of this immense city, with his ample description, that the writer on the state of Great Britain has followed until this day; one may consult his work.</p>
	<p>I cannot help then but to observe that most of the beautiful things, or the important establishments that one sees, are the fruit of the respected citizens' munificence that comes from their love of the public good, and the glory of being useful to their homeland.</p>
	<p>Water of the New River, which the inhabitants of ← London enjoy, besides the water of the Thames, is due to the care, to the skill and to the generosity of Sir Hugh Middleton. He began this work under his own auspices in 1608, and finished it at the end of five years, by employing about a hundred laborers every day. The river that furnishes this water, has its source in the county of Hartford, follows a path of 60 nautical miles, before it arrives in ← London , and passes under eight hundred bridges.</p>
	<p>The Royal Exchange, this magnificent building used by assemblies of merchants, and which has given so much amusement to Mr. Addison in The Spectator , was founded in 1566 by Sir Thomas Gresham, merchant, under the reign of Elizabeth. It is today an area in length 230 feet from east to west, and 171 feet from north to south, which cost 50 thousand pounds sterling; but as it produces 4 thousand pounds sterling in income, one can regard it as one of the richest properties in the world, in proportion to its size.</p>
	<p>The same Gresham, not content with this liberality, built the college that bears his name, and and there established professorial chairs, of 50 l. sterling for each one, besides lodging.</p>
	<p>One is indebted to individuals, guided by the same spirit, for the foundation of most of the public schools, for the good of the young people: for example, the so-called Merchant Taylors School, where a hundred students are taught free of charge; a hundred for two shillings 6 pence per quarter; and a hundred others for five shillings per quarter, (which does not make more than 3 or 6 pounds of our money per head, for three months.) This school, as I say, was founded by Thomas White, merchant tailor, of ← London ; he became a city Alderman and and was later knighted.</p>
	<p>In 1611 Mr. Sutton bought Chartreuse Monastery, 13 thousand l. sterling, and built a hospital to support liberally eighty persons, drawn from among the military and merchant classes.</p>
	<p>The same citizen also believed he owed something of merit to his compatriots who wanted to cultivate letters. In this regard, he founded a school, for learning of Latin and Greek by forty young people, in which the most capable passed afterward to University of Cambridge, or after its foundation, each one of them was annually furnished, for their expenses for a period of eight years, 30 l. sterling.</p>
	<p>The statue of Charles II that is in Soho Square, was built at the expense of Sir Robert Viner.</p>
	<p>But Gresham's Exchange, and all the buildings of which we have spoken, perished in the Great Fire of 1666, by which the city of ← London was almost entirely destroyed. This misfortune arriving after the Black Plague and hard upon an unhappy war against Holland, caused irreparable damage. Nonetheless, nothing has been seen like the riches, abundance and strength of this nation, when it is in agreement with itself, like the design it formed, as soon as the blaze ceased, to restore the stones and the bricks on the new plans, more regular and more magnificent, all that the fire removed of wooden buildings, to erect temples and public places, to make larger and straighter roads, and to resume the work of manufacturing and all the branches of commerce in general, and with more strength than beforehand; a plan that passed through the mind of other peoples, for the bravery of the English nation, the solidity of was justified after a short interval of time. Europe marveled, as quickly at the end of a three-year period ← London was rebuilt, more beautiful, more regular, more convenient than it was before, some taxes on coal, and everywhere the ardor and the zeal of citizens, sufficient to this work, equally immense and cutting, a fine example of what men can do, says Mr. Voltaire, and and which makes believable the stories one tells of the ancient cities of Asia and Egypt, built with as much celerity.</p>
	<p>← London is found built in the county of Middlesex, on the north side of the Thames, on an elevated hillside, situated on a base of gravel, and and in consequence very dry. The river there forms a crossroads; the sea rises for a period of four hours, lowers for a period of eight, and the loaded ships can almost arrive at the bridge of this metropolis; this is an infinite advantage for the prodigious commerce it does.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> London Listeni/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.[7][8] Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.[9] London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[10][11][12] which today largely makes up Greater London,[13][14][note 1] governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[15][note 2][16]</p>
	<p> London is a leading global city[17][18] in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation.[19][20][21] It is crowned as the world's largest financial centre[22][23][24][25] and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world.[note 3][26][27] London is a world cultural capital.[28][29][30] It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals[31] and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic.[32] London is the world's leading investment destination,[33][34][35] hosting more international retailers[36][37] and ultra high-net-worth individuals[38][39] than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[40] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.[41]</p>
	<p> London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.[42] Its estimated mid-2015 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,673,713,[2] the largest of any city in the European Union,[43] and accounting for 12.5% of the UK population.[44] London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[45] The city's metropolitan area is the most populous in the EU with 13,879,757 inhabitants,[note 4][3] while the Greater London Authority states the population of the city-region (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million.[46][47] London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.[48]</p>
	<p> London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT).[49] Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events, and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and West End theatres.[50] The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.</p>
	<p> Etymology</p>
	<p> Main article: Etymology of London</p>
	<p> The etymology of London is uncertain.[51] It is an ancient name, found in sources from the 2nd century.[AD?] It is recorded c.121 as Londinium, which points to Romano-British origin,[51] and hand-written Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 include the word Londinio ("in London").[52] The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae.[51] This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.[53]</p>
	<p> From 1898, it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant "place belonging to a man called *Londinos"; this explanation has since been rejected.[51] Richard Coates proposed in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning "river too wide to ford", and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon;[54] this requires quite a serious amendment however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain, which should demand[citation needed] a form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier *loundiniom. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.</p>
	<p> Until 1889, the name "London" officially applied only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now to Greater London.[55]</p>
	<p> History</p>
	<p> Prehistory</p>
	<p> Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge.[56] This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. Dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC.[56] In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge.[57] The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.[57]</p>
	<p> Roman London</p>
	<p> Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43 AD.[58] This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground.[59] The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.[60]</p>
	<p> With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450.[61] From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old Roman city.[62] By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking invasions. There are three recorded Viking assaults on London; two of these were successful, in 851 and 886, although the Vikings were defeated during another attack in 994.[63]</p>
	<p> The Vikings established Danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of England, with its boundary roughly stretching from London to Chester. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.[64]</p>
	<p> By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital."[65][66]</p>
	<p> Middle Ages</p>
	<p> After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[67] William constructed the Tower of London, the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants.[68] In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[69][70]</p>
	<p> In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[71] Disaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.[72] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[73]</p>
	<p> Early modern</p>
	<p> During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London passed from church to private ownership.[74] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.[75] But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.[76] The Royal Exchange was founded.[77] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[74]</p>
	<p> In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.[78]</p>
	<p> In the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[79] The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647[clarification needed],[80] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[81]</p>
	<p> London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[82] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[83]</p>
	<p> The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[84] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke[85][86][87] as Surveyor of London.[88] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.</p>
	<p> In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[89] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death,[90] including petty theft.[91] Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.[92] The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue[clarification needed] was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet[citation needed], acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power[citation needed]. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre[citation needed].[93]</p>
	<p> According to Samuel Johnson:</p>
	<p> You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.</p>
	<p> — Samuel Johnson, 1777[94]</p>

	<p> British volunteer recruits in London, August 1914</p>
	<p> A bombed-out London street during the Blitz of the Second World War</p>
	<p> London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.[48] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[95] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[96] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War,[97] and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London had barely recovered from the war.</p>
	<p> In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the "pea soup fogs" for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.</p>
	<p> A view from Victoria Tower, in late 1920s</p>
	<p> Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.</p>
	<p> Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.</p>
	<p> The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[98] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[99]</p>
	<p> In 2008, London named alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, being hailed as the world's three most influential global cities. In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939.[100] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London constituencies voted to remain in the EU. This led to over a hundred thousand Londoners petitioning Mayor Sadiq Khan to declare London's independence from the UK and rejoin the EU. Supporters cite London's status as a "world city" and its demographic and economic differences from the rest of the United Kingdom, and argue that it should become a city-state based on the model of Singapore, while remaining an EU member state.[101]</p>

	<p> Main articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government</p>
	<p> The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[102] The GLA consists of two elected components: the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[103][104] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[105] The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[106] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[107]</p>
	<p> The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world.[108] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[109] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames,[110][111] which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[112]</p>
	<p> National government</p>
	<p> 10 Downing Street, official residence of the Prime Minister</p>
	<p> London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[113] The British Parliament is often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright)[114] because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems.[114] There are 73 Members of Parliament (MPs) from London, elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. As of May 2015, 45 are from the Labour Party, 27 are Conservatives, and one is a Liberal Democrat.[115]</p>
	<p> Policing and crime</p>
	<p> Main article: Crime in London</p>
	<p> Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police Service, overseen by the Mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[116][117] The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[118] The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[119] A fourth police force in London, the Ministry of Defence Police, do not generally become involved with policing the general public.</p>
	<p> Crime rates vary widely by area, ranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe. Today crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority[120] and Ward level.[121] In 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[122] The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.[123]</p>
	<p> Geography</p>
	<p> Main article: Geography of London</p>
	<p> Scope</p>
	<p> Satellite view of inner London</p>
	<p> London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis.[note 5] The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.[124]</p>
	<p> Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[125][126] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[127]</p>
	<p> Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt,[128] although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[129] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.[130] The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W.[131] However the geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough of Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.[132]</p>
	<p> Status</p>
	<p> Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[133] The area of Greater London has incorporated areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[134] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written form.[note 6]</p>
	<p> Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[138] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.[13]</p>
	<p> Topography</p>
	<p> London from Primrose Hill</p>
	<p> London from Forest Hill</p>
	<p> Greater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).[139] Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[140]</p>
	<p> Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[141] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.[142]</p>
	<p> In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.[143]</p>
	<p> Climate</p>
	<p> Main article: Climate of London</p>
	<p> London in December 2013</p>
	<p> Average summertime day temperatures range between 20 and 26 °C (68 and 79 °F). Although uncommon, temperatures as high as 38 °C (100 °F) have been recorded.</p>
	<p> London has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb ), similar to all of southern England. Despite its reputation as being a rainy city, London receives less precipitation in a year than Rome, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Naples, Sydney and New York.[144][145][146][147][148][149] Temperature extremes for all sites in the London area range from 38.1 °C (100.6 °F) at Kew during August 2003[150] down to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt during January 1962.[151]</p>
	<p> Summers are mild, but generally warm. London's average July high is 24 °C (75.2 °F). On average London will see 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) each year, and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) every year. During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 °C (86.0 °F) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 °C (100.4 °F), leading to hundreds of heat related deaths.[152]</p>
	<p> Winters are generally cool, cloudy and damp with little temperature variation. Snowfall occurs occasionally and can cause travel disruption when this happens. Snowfall is more common in outer London. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[153] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. The effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles west of London, with the London Weather Centre, in the city centre.[154]</p>
	<p> Districts</p>
	<p> Main articles: List of districts of London and London boroughs</p>
	<p> London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.</p>
	<p> Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[159][160] The City of London is the main financial district,[161] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.</p>
	<p> The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[162] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[163] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[164][165]</p>
	<p> The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[166] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[166]</p>
	<p> Architecture</p>
	<p> Main articles: Architecture of London and List of tallest buildings and structures in London</p>
	<p> The Tower, with Tower Bridge built 800 years later on the River Thames</p>
	<p> London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.[167]</p>
	<p> Wren's late 17th-century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied architectural heritage.</p>
	<p> 30 St Mary Axe, also known as "the Gherkin", towers over St Andrew Undershaft. Modern architecture juxtaposed by historic architecture is seen often in London</p>
	<p> Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right</p>
	<p> The disused - but soon to be rejuvenated - 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[168] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.</p>
	<p> The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.[169]</p>
	<p> In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.</p>
	<p> Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape[170] and the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.</p>

	<p> Natural history</p>
	<p> The London Natural History Society suggest that London is "one of the World's Greenest Cities" with more than 40 percent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[171] They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two National Nature Reserves and 76 Local Nature Reserves.[172]</p>
	<p> Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slow-worms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[173]</p>
	<p> Fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London</p>
	<p> Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.[174][175]</p>
	<p> Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels,[176] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found including hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[177] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.[178]</p>
	<p> Among the strange sights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames,[179] while the BBC Two programme "Natural World: Unnatural History of London" shows pigeons using the London Underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market, and foxes that will "sit" if given sausages.[180]</p>
	<p> Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[181] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[182][183]</p>
	<p> Demography</p>
	<p> The 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of London's population are foreign-born making London the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. The table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of London residents. Note that some of the German-born population, in 18th position, are British citizens from birth born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[185] With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.[186]</p>
	<p> However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011,[45] while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used.[187][188] According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe. During the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000 immigrants arrived in London.[189]</p>
	<p> The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). The population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410/sq mi),[190] more than ten times that of any other British region.[191] In terms of population, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region in the world. As of 2014, London has the largest number of billionaires (British Pound Sterling) in the world, with 72 residing in the city.[192] London ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside Tokyo and Moscow.[193]</p>
	<p> Ethnic groups</p>
	<p> According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as Other White.</p>
	<p> 20.9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of full Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the population. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. Chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population, with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further 4.9 per cent are classified as "Other Asian".</p>
	<p> 15.6 per cent of London's population are of Black and mixed-Black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full Black descent, with those of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. Black Africans account for 7.0 per cent of London's population, with 4.2 per cent as Black Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as "Other Black". 5.0 per cent are of mixed race.</p>
	<p> Across London, Black and Asian children outnumber White British children by about six to four in state schools.[195] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8 per cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group.[196] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000.[197] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, in 2010, London's foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.</p>
	<p> The 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[198] A portion of the German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[199] Estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London in the period July 2009 to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[200]</p>
	<p> Religion</p>
	<p> According to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings are Christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), Hindus (5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5 per cent), Buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent).</p>
	<p> London has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[202] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[203]</p>
	<p> St Paul's Cathedral</p>
	<p> Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[204] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[205] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[206]</p>
	<p> London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities. Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[207] and the Baitul Futuh Mosque of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Hindus and Middle-Eastern Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair and Knightsbridge in West London.[208][209][210] There are large Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[211] Large Hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which is home to Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[212] London is also home to 42 Hindu temples. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[213]</p>
	<p> The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held regular services continuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998.[214] The community set up the London Jewish Forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[215]</p>
	<p> Accent</p>
	<p> There are many accents that are traditionally thought of as London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally.[216] The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE).[217] The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.</p>
	<p> Economy</p>
	<p> Main articles: Economy of London and Media in London</p>
	<p> The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[218]</p>
	<p> London generates about 20 per cent of the UK's GDP[219] (or $600 billion in 2014); while the economy of the London metropolitan area—the largest in Europe—generates about 30 per cent of the UK's GDP (or an estimated $669 billion in 2005).[220] London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[221][222] London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report.[223] As of 2015 the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of Brazil annual GDP.[224] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[225] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.[226]</p>
	<p> The City of London</p>
	<p> Aerial view of the City of London</p>
	<p> London finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[227][228] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[229] This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI)[230] and The Global Cities Index.[231]</p>
	<p> London's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 percent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[232] Over 85 percent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the City has recovered; put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[233] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.</p>
	<p> Over half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[234]</p>
	<p> Media and technology</p>
	<p> Media companies are concentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[235] The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the City. Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion.[236] The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[237]</p>
	<p> A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[238] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future [239] in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.[240]</p>
	<p> The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[241] and UK Power Networks.[242]</p>
	<p> Tourism</p>
	<p> Main article: Tourism in London</p>
	<p> The Natural History Museum</p>
	<p> London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[243][244] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[245] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003,[246] and the city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[247] As of 2016 London is the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[248]</p>
	<p> In 2015, the top most-visited attractions in UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue) [249]</p>
	<p> 1. The British Museum: 6,820,686</p>
	<p> 2. The National Gallery: 5,908,254</p>
	<p> 3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023</p>
	<p> 4. Southbank Centre: 5,102,883</p>
	<p> 5. Tate Modern: 4,712,581</p>

	<p> 9. Tower of London: 2,785,249</p>
	<p> 10. National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486</p>
	<p> 11. The number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[250]</p>
	<p> Housing crisis</p>
	<p> Main article: Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom</p>
	<p> Thousands of homeless families find themselves stuck in emergency accommodation for at least two years.[251] A growth in the number of UK households has led to the homeless charity Shelter stating: "This growth is a result of people living longer, more people living alone or in smaller households, and net migration."[252]</p>
	<p> Transport</p>
	<p> Main articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London</p>
	<p> A black London taxi, also known as a hackney carriage</p>
	<p> Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[253] however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
	<p> The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[254]</p>
	<p> Aviation</p>
	<p> Main article: Airports of London</p>
	<p> London Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic. (Terminal 5C is pictured)</p>
	<p> London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.</p>
	<p> London Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, is the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[255] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[256] There were plans for a third runway and a sixth terminal; however, these were cancelled by the Coalition Government on 12 May 2010.[257]</p>
	<p> Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles similar traffic, with some cheap short-haul flights.[258]</p>
	<p> Stansted Airport, north east of London in Essex, is a local UK hub.</p>
	<p> Luton Airport to the north of London in Bedfordshire, caters mostly for cheap short-haul flights.[259][260]</p>
	<p> London City Airport, the smallest and most central airport, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[261]</p>
	<p> London Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that mainly caters for cheap short-haul flights.</p>
	<p> Rail</p>
	<p> Underground and DLR</p>
	<p> The London Underground is the world's oldest and second-longest rapid transit system</p>
	<p> The London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube, is the oldest[262] and second longest[263] metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations[264] and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway.[265] It dates from 1863.[266]</p>
	<p> Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[267] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[268] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.</p>
	<p> Suburban</p>
	<p> King's Cross railway station Western Concourse</p>
	<p> There are 366 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[269] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers – Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[270][271] Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing.</p>
	<p> With the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is due to open in 2018. It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[272] It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[273][274]</p>
	<p> Inter-city and international</p>
	<p> St Pancras International is the main terminal for high speed Eurostar and HS1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Trains services</p>
	<p> London is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 percent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[275] Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including Birmingham, Brighton, Reading, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Exeter, Sheffield, Southampton, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Cambridge, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>
	<p> Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Paris, Brussels and European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[276] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[277] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.</p>
	<p> Freight</p>
	<p> Although rail freight levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste.[278] As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.[278]</p>
	<p> Buses and trams</p>
	<p> The red double decker bus is an iconic symbol of London</p>
	<p> London's bus network is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops.[279] In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per annum, more than the Underground.[279] Around £850 million is taken in revenue each year. London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world[280] and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.[281][282]</p>
	<p> London has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink, centred on Croydon in South London. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[283] Since June 2008 Transport for London has completely owned Tramlink, and it plans to spend £54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements.[284]</p>
	<p> Cable car</p>
	<p> London's first and only cable car, known as the Emirates Air Line, opened in June 2012. Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the city, the cable car is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares are charged. Costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.</p>

	<p> Cycling is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision.[285]</p>
	<p> Port and river boats</p>
	<p> From being the largest port in the world, the Port of London is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[237] Most of this actually passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.</p>
	<p> London has frequent river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers. These run up to every 20 minutes between Embankment Pier and North Greenwich Pier. The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year,[286] is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads. Other operators run both commuter and tourist boat services in London.</p>
	<p> Roads</p>
	<p> The A102, near Greenwich. This was one of the few routes proposed in the Ringways Plan within Inner London to be built.</p>
	<p> Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at 121.5 mi (195.5 km) long.[287][288] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.</p>
	<p> London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. The average speed of a car in the rush hour is 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[289]</p>
	<p> In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[290][291] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[292] London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent.[293] Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.[294]</p>

	<p> London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[318]</p>
	<p> Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B</p>
	<p> The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century Canterbury Tales set out for Canterbury from London – specifically, from the Tabard inn, Southwark. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work—most notably his play The Alchemist—was set in the city.[318] A Journal of the Plague Year (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[318] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[318] Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a "biography" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography.</p>
	<p> London has played a significant role in the film industry. Major studios within or bordering London include Twickenham, Ealing, Shepperton, Pinewood, Elstree and Borehamwood,[319] and a special effects and post-production community centred in Soho.

	<p> Museums and art galleries</p>
	<p> The British Museum</p>
	<p> London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.</p>
	<p> In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as "Albertopolis", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[321] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.</p>
	<p> Music</p>
	<p> The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events</p>

	<p> The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[329] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near the tourist attraction of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[330][331] Primrose Hill, immediately to the north of Regent's Park, at 256 feet (78 m)[332] is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.</p>
	<p> Close to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[333] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the south-east[334] and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the south-west,[335][336] Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[337]</p>
	<p> Close to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[338] There are also numerous parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the 320-hectare (790-acre) Hampstead Heath of North London,[339] and Epping Forest, which covers 2,476 hectares (6,118 acres)[340] in the east. Both are controlled by the City of London Corporation.[341][342] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.[343]</p>
	<p> Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[344]</p>

	eArt: `<p> Magic. The occult art or science which teaches how to do things which are beyond human powers.</p>
	<p> Magic, considered as the science of the first mages, was nothing but the study of wisdom; for at the time it was well-taken. But it is rare that Man is satisfied with the limits of knowledge, it is too simple for him. It is nearly impossible that a small number of learned people, in one era and in a country subject to a crass ignorance, would not quickly succumb to the temptation to appear greater than human. Thus, the mages of Chaldea and all the East, or rather their disciples (because it is with the latter that ideas are usually degenerated), attached themselves to astrology, divination, enchantment and curses; and soon the term “ magic ” became odious and inapt to designate a science equally illusory and contemptible. The daughter of ignorance and pride, this science stretches back into the depths of time. It would be difficult to determine its date of origin; intending to reduce the pains of humanity, it was born at the same time as our miseries. As a dark science, it is honored in countries where barbarism and coarseness reign. The Lapps and, in general, savage peoples cultivate magic and make a great deal of it.</p>
	<p> To write a complete treatise on magic , to consider it in its fullest sense, that is to say, in all the good and evil that it can do, one must distinguish between divine magic , natural magic and supernatural magic .</p>
	<p> First, divine magic is nothing but the particular knowledge of the plans and visions of sovereign wisdom that God (in his grace) has revealed to holy men filled with his spirit; the supernatural power that He enables them to predict the future, to make miracles and to read, so to speak, the heart of those to whom they have been sent. We must believe they had such gifts; even if science, clarified by faith, has no better idea, it reveres it in silence. But is it still so? I do not know and I believe that it may be doubted. It does not depend on us acquiring this desirable magic , which does not comes neither from ordinary life nor from the will; it is a gift from God.</p>
	<p> Second, by natural magic, we mean the in-depth study of nature and the amazing secrets that we find there; the inestimable benefits that this work has brought to humanity in nearly all the arts and sciences. These include physics, astronomy, medicine, agriculture, navigation, mechanics and, I would say even eloquence; because it is for the knowledge of nature and the inspiration which it fires the human spirit in particular, that the great masters are due for the impact which they had on their students, the passions which they have excited in them and the tears they have drawn from them.</p>
	<p> This magic, praiseworthy in itself, was developed far back in antiquity. It is evidenced by Greek fire and some other discoveries made by those writers of which we have spoken. In several areas, the ancients have surpassed us in this type of magic , but the invasions by the northern peoples proved to have the most disastrous consequences for our Europe, including the shocking blows from which science and the fine arts have had such pain in overcoming.</p>
	<p> Thus, for many centuries after Archimedes’ glass sphere, Architras’ flying wooden dove, the Emperor Leo’s singing golden birds, Boetius’ singing and flying bronze birds, hissing bronze serpents and other things, there was a country in Europe (but of neither of Vaucanson’s century nor country), there was, I say, a country in which came to the point of burning Brioché and his puppets. A French knight who would walk around and see in the fair a mare who was clever enough to respond exactly to his signals, as we have seen as much in what follows: was saddened in Spain to see an animal subjected to the Inquisition who used all his resources to escape its clutches. There are innumerable examples of natural events which, through ignorance, were treated as black magic and evil. How were those who first spoke of the Antipodes and the New World treated?</p>
	<p> But we are gradually recovering from this former attitude and one can say that the awareness of this so-called natural magic is, even in the eyes of the multitude, continually retreating. Under the light of science we are, happily, continuously discovering the secrets and systems of nature, supported by many sound experiences which show humanity of what it is capable itself and without magic . Thus, we see the compass, the telescope, the microscope and, in our own time, polyps and electricity. In chemistry and physics, the most beautiful and useful discoveries will immortalize our era and if Europe were to fall back into the barbarism from which it has finally emerged, we will seem like magicians to our barbarous successors.</p>
	<p> Third, supernatural magic is which is properly called magic. This black magic, that always takes offense, that leads to pride, ignorance and the rejection of science; it is this which Agrippa included under the labels “celestial” and “ceremonial” . It had no science but the name and nothing but a confused heap of obscure, ambiguous and inconclusive principles, practices which were generally arbitrary and childish, the uselessness of which is shown by the nature of things.</p>
	<p> Agrippa, who was also a philosopher as well as a magician, used the term celestial magic to describe judicial astrology which attributed to spirits some domination over the planets, and to the planets some domination over men. He also claimed that different constellations influenced the tendencies, destiny and good or bad fortune of men. On these weak foundations, he built a ridiculous system, which does not dare appear these days except in the Liege Almanac and other similar books. These pathetic collections of material nourish popular errors and prejudices.</p>
	<p> Ceremonial magic, according to Agrippa, is incontrovertibly the most odious of these fruitless sciences. It consists of the invocation of demons who respond according to an express or tacit agreement made with the powers of darkness. He claims they have the power to harm their enemies, to produce evil and pernicious effects which the unhappy victims of their furor cannot avoid.</p>
	<p> Magic is divided into several branches, according to its differing objects and operations: cabals, spells, enchantment, evoking the spirit of the dead or of evil spirits, discovery of hidden treasure; as well as the greater secret arts: divination, prophecy, healing the most stubborn illnesses by mysterious means, attending a witches Sabbath, etc. Of what failings is the human mind not capable! It is shown in all these dreams.</p>
	<p> Philosophy’s ultimate task is to finally disabuse humanity of these imaginary humiliations. It has fought superstition, even joining with Theology (with which it has rarely made common cause). But finally in countries where people think, reflect and doubt, demons play a small role and diabolical magic remains discredited and held in contempt.</p>
	<p> But let’s not flatter our style of thinking here: we are a bit late for that; open the records of the smallest court of justice and you will find immense register of proceedings against sorcerers, magicians and enchanters. That the judiciary enriched themselves from the spoils and the confiscation of goods relating to alleged sorcerers is perhaps more illuminating than a funeral pyre. At least it is true that often the passion of the people often overwhelmed their credulity and led them to regard as a sorcerer or doctor of magic those who they would have not otherwise paid attention to. Similarly, according to the judicious remark of Apuleius (who had previously been accused of magic), “this crime,” he said “ is not believed by those who accuse others, because if a man was quite convinced that another man could kill by magic , he would be afraid to irritate him by accusing him of such an abominable crime.”</p>
	<p> Leonora Galigaï, the wife of the famous Marshal of Ancre, provides a memorable example of a disastrous accusation of an imaginary crime, fomented by a secret passion and born out of a dangerous court intrigue. But there are few examples of this type better known than that of the famous Urbain Grandier, the priest and canon of Loudun, who was burnt alive as a magician in the year 629. It is appalling that a philosopher who was merely a friend of humanity would have to suffer the pain of being an unhappy sacrifice to the simplicity of some and the barbarism of others! How are we to understand someone cold-bloodedly condemned as a magician to perish in the flames, judged by the statement of Astaroth, devil of the order of seraphim, of d'Easas, de Celsus, d'Acaos, de Cédon, d'Asmodée, devils of the order of the throne ; d'Alex, de Zabulon, Nephtalim, de Cham, d'Uriel, d'Ahaz, of the order of princes? How are we to understand the unhappy canon judged unmercifully on the word of those monks and nuns who said that he had raised the legions of infernal spirits? How is one not discomfited by seeing someone burned alive who is alleged to be magical , chased and defamed as a magician to the same pyre where a black fly of the order of those who call themselves bumblebees and who practiced on the head of Grandier were led by a monk who doubtlessly had read in the Council of Quieres that devils came to tempt a man at his death; taken, I say, for Beelzebub, lord of the flies, who flew around Grandier in order to take his sould to Hell? A puerile observation perhaps, but in the mouth of the monk, it was one of the least bad arguments that a barbarous mob could use to justify its excess, resulting from the absurd stories imposed on the disastrous credulity of simple people. What Horrors! Where will the human spirit not descend when it is blinded by the unhappy passions of envy and vengeance? One must certainly respect Gabriel Naudé for having generously undertaken the defense of great men accused of magic , but I think that they owe more to the rise of science which highlighted the vanity of the accusations than to the zeal of their advocate who, perhaps, had more courage than the cleverness or force of his arguments. If Naudé could have exonerated the great men from an imputation which evaporated in the light of common sense and reason: in spite of all his zeal, he had clearly failed. If he had undertaken to clear the wise men of antiquity entirely in this regard, then all their philosophy could not have sheltered them from the outrageous superstition of the magic they embraced.</p>
	<p> I will not cite another example, save that of Cato. He had the idea that one could heal the most serious maladies by magic words. Here are those barbarous words, which, at least according to him, were a certain recipe to restore his ailing patients: Incipe cantare in alto S : F. motas danata dardaries astotaries, dic una parite usque dum coeant, etc. [Begin to chant over the affected areas, “dardaries, astotaries,” and repeat until they come together.] This is from Alde Manuce’s edition, since that of Henri Estienne, revised and corrected by Victorius, was considerably changed to the point that its obscurity became greatly attacked by the critics.</p>
	<p> Everyone knows that the ancients put great significance to the magical word abracadabra. Q. Serenus, a famous doctor, claimed that a meaningless word written on paper and hung around the neck was a sure remedy for quarte fever. Undoubtedly, with such principles, this superstition was a complete pharmacy and the faith of the patient was his own best resource.</p>
	<p> It is to this faith that one can and one must attribute the reports of remarkable recoveries that seemed to come from magic , but which, underneath, were nearly always pious frauds or the results of this superstition that could not triumph too frequently over good sense, reason and even science. Our prejudices, errors and follies help each other. Fear is the daughter of ignorance; the latter produces superstition, which is, in its turn, the mother of fantasy, a rich source of error, illusion, phantoms, an over-heated imagination which creates imps, werewolves, ghosts and demons, which all jostle together. How can any mind in this state not believe all the fantasies of magic ? If fanaticism is pious and devout (and it is nearly always shown this way), it will see magic as part of the glory of God; at the least it will attribute to magic the privilege of saving and damning without appeal. There is no worse magic than that of the falsely devout. In conclusion, once could as well call the Sabbath the empire of the subterranean Amazons; at least there have always been more witches than wizards, we rightly attribute magic to the weak spirit or excessive curiosity of women. Daughters of Eve, they would lose their souls in order to know. But an anonymous writer (See Alector ou le Coq, Book II of the adepts) who would persuade the public that he is one of Satan’s closest confidantes, attributes to demons a lewd spirit which justifies their predilection for sex and the favors which they are granted. But this rationale would justly apply to part of the human race for whom, ordinarily, one cannot win for losing.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Magic (sometimes referred to as stage or street magic to distinguish it from paranormal or ritual magic) is one of the oldest performing arts in the world in which audiences are entertained by staged tricks or illusions of seemingly impossible or supernatural feats using natural means.[1][2] These feats are called magic tricks, effects, or illusions.</p>
	<p> History[edit]</p>
	<p> The term "magic" etymologically derives from the Greek word mageia (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and Persians had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called magosh in Persian, came to be known as magoi in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as mageia, and then magika—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. The first book containing explanations of magic tricks appeared in 1584. During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, who had a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.[3] As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials. Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout history.[citation needed] For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.[4] The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the Trojan Horse would also have been used for entertainment, or at least for cheating in money games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and cults from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Magic tricks[edit]</p>
	<p> Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then "restore" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magical routines use combinations of effects.</p>
	<p> An illustration from Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the "Decollation of John Baptist" decapitation illusion may be performed</p>
	<p> One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, Natural and Unnatural Magic, which describes and explains old-time tricks.[5] In 1584 Englishman Reginald Scot, published The Discoverie of Witchcraft, part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their 'magic tricks' were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were 'sleight-of-hand' manipulations with rope, paper and coins. At the time, fear and belief in witchcraft was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.[6] All obtainable copies were burned on the accession of James I in 1603 and those remaining are now rare. It began to reappear in print in 1651.</p>
	<p> During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including The Art of Conjuring (1614) and The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling (c.1675).</p>
	<p> Advertisement for Isaac Fawkes' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George</p>
	<p> Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing, juggling and fire breathing. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, Isaac Fawkes, who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for King George II. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:</p>
	<p> He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.[7]</p>
	<p> From 1756 to 1781, Jacob Philadelphia performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout Europe and in Russia.</p>
	<p> Modern stage magic[edit]</p>
	<p> Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, pioneer of modern magical entertainment</p>
	<p> A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann.</p>
	<p> John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as The Great Wizard of the North. His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845.</p>
	<p> John Nevil Maskelyne, a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.</p>
	<p> Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.[3] The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke established their own theatre, the Egyptian Hall, in London's Piccadilly, in 1873. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often Oriental) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view. Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being levitation.[8]</p>
	<p> The model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was Alexander Herrmann (February 10, 1844 – December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the "first-family of magic."</p>
	<p> The escapologist and magician Harry Houdini took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a Houdini Museum dedicated to him in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p> The Magic Circle was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic.[9]</p>
	<p> As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th and 21st century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok and Derren Brown. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects.</p>
	<p> Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous Pepper's Ghost, a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.</p>
	<p> Categories of effects[edit]</p>
	<p> Opinions vary among magicians as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider "penetrations" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as Guy Hollingworth[10] and Tom Stone[11] have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as Dariel Fitzkee, Harlan Tarbell, S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.</p>
	<p> Production: The magician produces something from nothing—a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a dove from a pan, or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage—all of these effects are productions.</p>
	<p> Vanish: The magician makes something disappear—a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the Statue of Liberty. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.</p>
	<p> Transformation: The magician transforms something from one state into another—a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a tiger, an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card.</p>
	<p> File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv</p>
	<p> Transformation: Change of color</p>
	<p> Restoration: The magician destroys an object—a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a woman is cut in half, a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces—then restores it to its original state.</p>
	<p> Transposition: This is whereby two or more objects are used in play. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else.</p>
	<p> Transportation: The magician causes something to move from one place to another—a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theater, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production. When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.</p>
	<p> Escape: The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., handcuffs or a straitjacket) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.</p>
	<p> Levitation: The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few inches off the floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including Asrah levitation, Balducci levitation, and King levitation. The flying illusion has often been performed by David Copperfield and more recently by Peter Marvey. Harry Blackstone floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.</p>
	<p> Penetration: The magician makes a solid object pass through another—a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as "solid-through-solid".</p>
	<p> Prediction: The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event—a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate—under seemingly impossible circumstances.</p>
	<p> Many magical routines use combinations of effects. For example, in "cups and balls" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.</p>
	<p> The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.</p>
	<p> Learning magic[edit]</p>
	<p> See also: List of magic publications</p>
	<p> A stage magician using a top hat as a prop</p>
	<p> Dedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art.[12] The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.[citation needed] Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession [13] to prevent the laity from learning their secrets. This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.</p>
	<p> From the 1584 publication of Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.</p>
	<p> Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magical secrets.</p>
	<p> The world's largest magic organization is the International Brotherhood of Magicians; it publishes a monthly journal, The Linking Ring. The oldest organization is the Society of American Magicians, which publishes the monthly magazine M-U-M and of which Houdini was a member and president for several years. In London, England, there is The Magic Circle, which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers[14]—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic[15] in London's The Strand is the world's oldest family-run magic shop.[16] The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, is home to the Academy of Magical Arts.</p>
	<p> Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. Stage illusions use large-scale props and even large animals. Platform magic is performed for a medium to large audience. Close-up magic is performed with the audience close to the magician. Escapology involves escapes from confinement or restraints. Pickpocket magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. Mentalism creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magical performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games.</p>
	<p> Types of magic performance[edit]</p>
	<p> Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres.</p>
	<p> A mentalist on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900</p>
	<p> Amateur magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience</p>
	<p> Stage illusions are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include Harry Blackstone, Sr., Howard Thurston, Chung Ling Soo, David Copperfield, Lance Burton, Siegfried & Roy, and Harry Blackstone, Jr.</p>
	<p> Parlor magic is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T.A. Waters, "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." Also, many magicians consider the term "parlor" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be "platform," "club" or "cabaret." Examples of such magicians include Jeff McBride, David Abbott, Channing Pollock, Black Herman, and Fred Kaps.</p>
	<p> Micromagic (also known as close-up magic or table magic) is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards (see Card manipulation), coins (see Coin magic), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called "table magic", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. Ricky Jay, Mahdi Moudini, and Lee Asher, following in the traditions of Dai Vernon, Slydini, and Max Malini, are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.</p>
	<p> Escapology is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. Harry Houdini is a well-known example of an escape artist or escapologist.</p>
	<p> Pickpocket magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include James Freedman, David Avadon, Bob Arno, and Apollo Robbins.</p>
	<p> Mentalism creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include Alexander, The Zancigs, Axel Hellstrom, Dunninger, Kreskin, Derren Brown, Rich Ferguson, Guy Bavli, and Banachek.</p>
	<p> Theatrical séances simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.</p>
	<p> Children's magic is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.</p>
	<p> Online magic tricks were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,[17] became a viral phenomenon that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that Snopes dedicated a page to debunking the trick.[18]</p>
	<p> Mathemagic is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and mathematics. It is commonly used by children's magicians and mentalists.</p>
	<p> Corporate magic or trade show magic uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock[19] and Guy Bavli.[20][21]</p>
	<p> Gospel magic uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by St. Don Bosco to interest children in 19th-century Turin, Italy to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.</p>
	<p> Street magic is a form of street performing or busking that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed 'in the round' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include Jeff Sheridan and Gazzo. Since the first David Blaine TV special Street Magic aired in 1997, the term "street magic" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include David Blaine and Cyril Takayama.</p>
	<p> Bizarre magic uses mystical, horror, fantasy, and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. Charles Cameron has generally been credited as the "godfather of bizarre magic." Others such as Tony Andruzzi have contributed significantly to its development.</p>
	<p> Shock magic is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as "geek magic," it takes its roots from circus sideshows, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, needle-through-arm, string through neck and pen-through-tongue.</p>
	<p> Comedy magic is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include Ed Alonzo, Penn & Teller, and Levent.</p>
	<p> Quick change magic is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos & Victoria Petrosyan.</p>
	<p> Camera magic (or "video magic") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as Derren Brown's lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of Criss Angel's illusions.</p>
	<p> Misuse of magic[edit]</p>
	<p> Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term "magician" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of "illusionist" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer Jamy Ian Swiss makes these points by billing himself as an "honest liar."[22] Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theater, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist Joseph Dunninger, who states "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice."[23]</p>
	<p> These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magical performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.</p>
	<p> Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magical performance.</p>
	<p> Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in paranormal phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the Spiritualism religious movement as well as public interest in séances, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and telekinetic effects, which they attributed to the actions of ghosts or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist Harry Houdini devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.[24] Magician James Randi, magic duo Penn & Teller, and the mentalist Derren Brown have also devoted much time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims.[25][26]</p>
	<p> Fraudulent faith healers have also been shown to employ sleight of hand to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet "tumors" from patients' abdomens.[27]</p>
	<p> Con men and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at the Card Table by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as "Find the Lady" or "Three-card Monte" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious.

	<p> Researching magic[edit]</p>
	<p> Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge.[29] Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,[30] which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center,[31] which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.</p>
	<p> Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers[32] of the time.</p>
	<p> Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author[33] has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magical performers.</p>
	<p> Several notable public research collections on magic are the WG Alma Conjuring Collection[34] at the State Library of Victoria; the R. B. Robbins Collection of Stage Magic and Conjuring[35] at the State Library of NSW; the H. Adrian Smith Collection of Conjuring and Magicana[36] at Brown University; and the Carl W. Jones Magic Collection, 1870s–1948[37] at Princeton University.</p>`

	<p>  Man. A Feeling, reflecting, thinking being, who freely walks the earth, who seems to be at the head of all other animals whom he dominates, who lives in society, who has invented the sciences and the arts, who has his particular goodness and badness, who has given himself masters, who has made laws for himself, etc.</p>
	<p>  He can be considered in many ways; the main ones will become the subject matter of articles that follow.</p>
	<p>  Man is composed of two substances, one known as soul (see Soul) the other known as body.</p>
	<p>  The body or the material part of man has been studied a great deal. Those who have concerned themselves with this important and difficult work are called anatomists (see article Man (Anatomy)).</p>
	<p>  We have followed man from the moment he is formed and life begins, until death. This is the natural history of man. (See article Man (Natural History).) We have considered him capable of different intellectual operations that render him good or bad, useful or harmful, capable of doing good or not. (See article Man (Ethics).)</p>
	<p>  From this solitary state we have passed to man in society and have proposed certain general principles according to which the ruling powers could derive more advantages. This article is entitled Man (Political science).</p>
	<p>  One could have increased infinitely the glimpses one has of man. His curiosity, his work, his needs relate him to all aspects of nature. There is nothing that cannot be linked to him. This is proven by the various articles in this work where one will see man either trying to know what surrounds him or striving to make use of his environment.</p>

	<p> A man is a male human. The term man is usually reserved for an adult male, with the term boy being the usual term for a male child or adolescent. However, the term man is also sometimes used to identify a male human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "men's basketball".</p>
	<p> Like most other male mammals, a man's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. The male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. However, there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> The English term "man" is derived from a Proto-Indo-European root *man- (see Sanskrit/Avestan manu-, Slavic mǫž "man, male").[1] More directly, the word derives from Old English mann. The Old English form had a default meaning of "adult male" (which was the exclusive meaning of wer), though it could also signify a person of unspecified gender. The closely related Old English pronoun man was used just as it is in Modern German to designate "one" (e. g., in the saying man muss mit den Wölfen heulen).[2] The Old English form is derived from Proto-Germanic *mannz, "human being, person", which is also the etymon of German Mann "man, husband" and man "one" (pronoun), Old Norse maðr, and Gothic manna. According to Tacitus, the mythological progenitor of the Germanic tribes was called Mannus. *Manus in Indo-European mythology was the first man, see Mannus, Manu (Hinduism).</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Age and terminology</h4>
	<p> The term manhood is used to describe the period in a human male's life after he has transitioned from boyhood, having passed through puberty, usually having attained male secondary sexual characteristics, and symbolises a male's coming of age. The word man is used to mean any adult male. In English-speaking countries, many other words can also be used to mean an adult male such as guy, dude, buddy, bloke, fellow, chap and sometimes boy or lad. The term manhood is associated with masculinity and virility, which refer to male qualities and male gender roles.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Biology and sex</h4>
	<p> Humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.</p>
	<p> • Some examples of male secondary sexual characteristics in humans, those acquired as boys become men or even later in life, are:</p>
	<p> • more pubic hair</p>
	<p> • more facial hair</p>
	<p> • larger hands and feet</p>
	<p> • broader shoulders and chest</p>
	<p> • larger skull and bone structure</p>
	<p> • larger brain mass and volume</p>
	<p> • greater muscle mass</p>
	<p> • a more prominent Adam's apple and deeper voice</p>
	<p> • greater height</p>
	<p> • a higher tibia:femur ratio (a longer shinbone in comparison to the thighbone)</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Sexual characteristics</h3>
	<p> In mankind, the sex of an individual is generally determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell. If a sperm cell carrying an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be female (XX); if a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). Persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as intersex.</p>
	<p> This is referred to as the XY sex-determination system and is typical of most mammals, but quite a few other sex-determination systems exist, including some that are non-genetic.</p>
	<p> The term primary sexual characteristics denotes the kind of gamete the gonad produces: the ovary produces egg cells in the female, and the testis produces sperm cells in the male. The term secondary sexual characteristics denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Gender</h3>
	<p> Biological factors are not sufficient determinants of whether a person considers themselves a man or is considered a man. Intersex individuals, who have physical or genetic features considered to be mixed or atypical for one sex or the other, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. There are also transgender and transsexual men, who were assigned as female at birth, but identify as men; there are varying social, legal and individual definitions with regard to these issues. (See transman.)</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Reproductive system</h3>
	<p> Human male reproductive anatomy and surroundings.</p>
	<p> The male sex organs are part of the reproductive system, consisting of the penis, testicles, vas deferens, and the prostate gland. The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. The concept of fatherhood and family exists in human societies. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Sex hormones</h3>
	<p> In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated embryo, testosterone stimulates the development of the Wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum. Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the Anti-müllerian hormone, which inhibits development of the Müllerian ducts.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Illnesses</h3>
	<p> In general, men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women. In comparison to women, men suffer from slightly more illnesses.[citation needed] Male life expectancy is slightly lower than female life expectancy, although the difference has narrowed in recent years.</p>
	<p> For males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis, along with the full sexual distinction of a human male from a human female, while women are acted upon by estrogens and progesterones to produce their sexual distinction from the human male.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Masculinity</h4>
	<p> The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (December 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)</p>
	<p> Michelangelo's David is the classical image of youthful male beauty in Western art.</p>
	<p> Masculinity has its roots in genetics (see gender).[4][5] Therefore, while masculinity looks different in different cultures, there are common aspects to its definition across cultures.[6] Sometimes gender scholars will use the phrase "hegemonic masculinity" to distinguish the most dominant form of masculinity from other variants. In the mid-twentieth century United States, for example, John Wayne might embody one form of masculinity, while Albert Einstein might be seen as masculine, but not in the same "hegemonic" fashion.</p>
	<p> Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class. In western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this.[7][8] An association with physical or moral strength is implied. Masculinity is associated more commonly with adult men than with boys.</p>
	<p> A great deal is now known about the development of masculine characteristics. The process of sexual differentiation specific to the reproductive system of Homo sapiens produces a female by default. The SRY gene on the Y chromosome, however, interferes with the default process, causing a chain of events that, all things being equal, leads to testes formation, androgen production, and a range of both pre-natal and post-natal hormonal effects covered by the terms masculinization or virilization. Because masculinization redirects biological processes from the default female route, it is more precisely called defeminization.</p>
	<p> There is an extensive debate about how children develop gender identities.</p>
	<p> In many cultures displaying characteristics not typical to one's gender may become a social problem for the individual. Among men, the exhibition of feminine behavior may be considered a sign of homosexuality, while the same is for a woman who exhibits masculine behavior. Within sociology such labeling and conditioning is known as gender assumptions and is a part of socialization to better match a culture's mores. The corresponding social condemnation of excessive masculinity may be expressed in terms such as "machismo" or "testosterone poisoning."</p>
	<p> The relative importance of the roles of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity continues to be debated. While social conditioning obviously plays a role, it can also be observed that certain aspects of the masculine identity exist in almost all human cultures.</p>
	<p> The historical development of gender role is addressed by such fields as behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, human ecology and sociobiology. All human cultures seem to encourage the development of gender roles, through literature, costume and song. Some examples of this might include the epics of Homer, the King Arthur tales in English, the normative commentaries of Confucius or biographical studies of Muhammad. More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in works such as the Bhagavad Gita or bushido's Hagakure.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Culture and gender roles</h4>
	<p> Well into prehistoric culture, men are believed to have assumed a variety of social and cultural roles which are likely similar across many groups of humans. In hunter-gatherer societies, men were often if not exclusively responsible for all large game killed, the capture and raising of most or all domesticated animals, the building of permanent shelters, the defense of villages, and other tasks where the male physique and strong spatial-cognition were most useful.[citation needed] Some anthropologists believe that it may have been men who led the Neolithic Revolution and became the first pre-historical ranchers, as a possible result of their intimate knowledge of animal life.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Throughout history, the roles of men have changed greatly. As societies have moved away from agriculture as a primary source of jobs, the emphasis on male physical ability has waned. Traditional gender roles for working men typically involved jobs emphasizing moderate to hard manual labor (see Blue-collar worker), often with no hope for increase in wage or position. For poorer men among the working classes, the need to support their families, especially during periods of industrial change and economic decline, forced them to stay in dangerous jobs working long arduous hours, often without retirement. Many industrialized countries have seen a shift to jobs which are less physically demanding, with a general reduction in the percentage of manual labor needed in the work force (see White-collar worker). The male goal in these circumstances is often of pursuing a quality education and securing a dependable, often office-environment, source of income.</p>
	<p> The Men's Movement is in part a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with women, and for equal rights irrespective of gender, even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to the habits and customs recent history has produced. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades, men in some societies now compete with women for jobs that traditionally excluded women. Some larger corporations have instituted tracking systems to try to ensure that jobs are filled based on merit and not just on traditional gender selection. Assumptions and expectations based on sex roles both benefit and harm men in Western society (as they do women, but in different ways) in the workplace as well as on the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and fatherhood - to name a few. Research has identified anti-male sexism in some areas which can result in what appear to be unfair advantages given to women.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.[9] The examples are based on the context of the culture and infrastructure of the United States. However, these extreme positions are rarely found in reality; actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. The most common 'model' followed in real life in the United States and Great Britain is the 'model of double burden'.[clarification needed]</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Exclusively male roles</h3>
	<p> Some positions and titles are reserved for men only. For example, the position of Pope and Bishop in the Roman Catholic Church. Also the priesthood is exclusively male in the Catholic Church and also some other religious traditions. Men are often given priority for the position of monarch (King in the case of a man) of a country, as it usually passes to the eldest male child upon succession.</p>

	eArt: `<p> Mexico, City of. North American city, the greatest in the New World, capital of New Spain, with an archbishopric established in 1547, a royal audience, a university, if one can call by this name the schools of Spanish America</p>
	<p> It was the capital of the empire of Mexico until 13 August 1521, when Cortez captured it once and for all, and ended this famous empire. We will see what it once was, before speaking of its present state</p>
	<p> This city, established in the middle of a large lake, offered to the eyes the most beautiful monument of American industriousness. It was connected to dry land by its dikes or main causeways, sumptuous works that served as adornment no less than necessity. The streets were wide, interrupted by many bridges, and appeared as if drawn with cords. One saw in the city innumerable boats sailing everywhere for necessities, and commerce. One saw in Mexico spacious and comfortable houses made of stone, eight grand temples that rose above the other buildings, plazas, markets, and shops that glittered with gold work and carved silver, with glazed ceramic vessels, cotton cloth, and feather work that formed dazzling designs of the most vivid colors</p>
	<p> Buying and selling was done by means of exchange; each gave that which he had in surplus, in order to have that which he lacked. Maize and cocoa served only as money for things of little value. There was a house where the judges of commerce had their tribunal, to settle differences between merchants; other lesser ministers went about the markets, maintaining equitable trades by their presence</p>
	<p> Several palaces of the Emperor Moctezuma augmented the sumptuousness of the city. One of them was supported by jasper columns, and was intended to amuse the sense of sight with several ponds covered with the sea and river birds most admirable for their plumage. Another was decorated with an aviary for birds of prey. A third was filled with offensive and defensive arms, bows, arrows, slings, swords with flint blades set in wooden bases, etc. A fourth was given over to the support and feeding of dwarfs, hunchbacks, and other deformed or crippled people, of both sexes and all ages. A fifth was surrounded by large gardens, where only medicinal plants were cultivated, that the attendants gave out freely to the sick. The doctors reported to the king about their effects, and by keeping a register in their manner, without the use of writing. The other types of magnificence marked only progress in the arts, the last two marked progress in morality, as M. de Voltaire says</p>
	<p> Cortez, after his conquest, reflecting on the advantages and convenience of the location of Mexico , divided it among the conquerors, and had it rebuilt; after having marked the places for the city hall, and for the other public buildings. He separated the Spanish dwelling places from those of the rest of the Indians, promising everybody who wanted to come and dwell there, situations and privileges, and gave an entire street to the son of Moctezuma, to win the affection of the Mexicans. The descendants of this famous emperor still remain in this city, and are ordinary Christian gentlemen, lost among the multitude</p>
	<p> Mexico is today located in a vast sheet of water, surrounded by a circle of mountains about forty leagues around. In the rainy season, which begins around the month of May, one can enter the town only by three causeways, of which the smallest is half a league long; the other two are one league and a league and a half; however, during the dry season, the lake in the middle of which the city is located, diminishes considerably. The Spaniards were forced to divert the waters across the neighboring mountains, but after immense works, executed at the cost of the days of the unfortunate Mexicans, they were only partially successful in the execution of this project; nevertheless, they remediated through their works the inundations, with which this city was often menaced.</p>
	<p> Today the city is built in a regular fashion, and crossed by canals, which are filled by waters that come from the lake. The houses are low, because of the frequent earth tremors; the streets are wide, and the churches very beautiful. There is a very large number of religious houses.</p>
	<p> One counted at least three hundred thousand souls in Mexico under the rule of Moctezuma; now, one would not find sixty thousand, among whom there are only ten thousand whites; the rest of the inhabitants are Indians, Negroes from Africa, Mulattoes, Mestizos, and others, who are descended from the mixture of these diverse nations among themselves, and with Europeans; who have formed a population of all shades of colors, from white to black.</p>
	<p> Tis is, nevertheless, a very wealthy city because of commerce, because via the North Atlantic Ocean some twenty large vessels arrive every year at St. John de Ulúa, called Veracruz today, filled with the merchandise of Christendom, which is quickly transported by land to Mexico . Via the South Pacific Ocean the city trades with Peru and with the East Indies via the entrepot of the Philippines, which sends each year two galleons to Acapulco, where the merchandise is unloaded, in order to carry it by land to Mexico .</p>
	<p> Finally, if one considers the quantity of silver that is carried from the mines into this city, the magnificence of the sacred buildings, the large number of coaches that roll through the streets, the immense riches of several Spaniards who live there, one will think that it is a prodigiously opulent city: but, on the other hand, when one sees that the Indians who are four-fifths of the inhabitants, are so badly dressed, that they go about without shirts or under garments and barefoot, it is hard to persuade oneself that this city is really so rich.</p>
	<p> It is located 22 leagues from Puebla, 75 from Acapulco, and 80 from Veracruz. Long. according to Father Feuillée and des Places, 272 deg. 21 min 30 sec. lat. 20°10' . Long. according to Cassini and Lieutaud, 273° 51' 30" lat 20° . Long. according to M. De Lisle, 275° 15' lat. 20° 10' .</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Mexico (Spanish: México, pronounced: [ˈme.xi.ko] ( listen), modern Nahuatl Listen), officially the United Mexican States (Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos, About this sound listen (help·info)),[10][11][12][13] is a federal republic in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.[14] Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi),[13] Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million,[15] it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.</p>
	<p> Pre-Columbian Mexico was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec before first contact with Europeans. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain. Three centuries later, this territory became Mexico following recognition in 1821 after the colony's Mexican War of Independence. The tumultuous post-independence period was characterized by economic instability and many political changes. The Mexican–American War (1846–48) led to the territorial cession of the extensive northern territories to the United States. The Pastry War, the Franco-Mexican War, a civil war, two empires and a domestic dictatorship occurred through the 19th century. The dictatorship was overthrown in the Mexican Revolution of 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country's current political system.</p>
	<p> Mexico has the fifteenth largest nominal GDP and the eleventh largest by purchasing power parity. The Mexican economy is strongly linked to those of its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, especially the United States.[16][17] Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), joining in 1994. It is classified as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank[18] and a newly industrialized country by several analysts.[19][20][21][22] By 2050, Mexico could become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[23][24] The country is considered both a regional power and middle power,[25][26][27][28] and is often identified as an emerging global power.[29] Due to its rich culture and history, Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[30][31][32] Mexico is a megadiverse country, ranking fourth in the world by biodiversity. In 2016 it was the eighth most visited country in the world, with 35 million international arrivals.[33] Mexico is a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G8+5, the G20, the Uniting for Consensus and the Pacific Alliance.</p>
	<p> Etymology</p>
	<p> Mēxihco is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, namely,[34] the Valley of Mexico, and its people, the Mexica, and surrounding territories. This became the future State of Mexico as a division of New Spain prior to independence (compare Latium). It is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance as a result, or vice versa. After New Spain won independence from Spain, representatives decided to name the new country after its capital, Mexico City. This was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.</p>
	<p> Traditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from Nahuatl tetl [ˈtetɬ] ("rock") and nōchtli [ˈnoːtʃtɬi] ("prickly pear") and is often thought to mean "Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as "the Bancroft dialogues" suggests the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.[35]</p>
	<p> The suffix -co is the Nahuatl locative, making the word a place name. Beyond that, the etymology is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is derived from Mextli or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Mexica, Huitzilopochtli, in which case Mēxihco means "Place where Huitzilopochtli lives".[36] Another hypothesis suggests that Mēxihco derives from a portmanteau of the Nahuatl words for "Moon" (Mētztli) and navel (xīctli).[37] This meaning ("Place at the Center of the Moon") might refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon. Still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of maguey.[37]</p>
	<p> The name of the city-state was transliterated to Spanish as México with the phonetic value of the letter 'x' in Medieval Spanish, which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ]. This sound, as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative [ʒ], represented by a 'j', evolved into a voiceless velar fricative [x] during the 16th century. This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling. In recent years the Real Academia Española, which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is México.[38] The majority of publications in all Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used.[citation needed] In English, the 'x' in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster [ks].</p>
	<p> The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed. The declaration of independence signed on November 6, 1813 by the deputies of the Congress of Anáhuac called the territory América Septentrional (Northern America). On two occasions (1821–1823 and 1863–1867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano (Mexican Empire). All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos[39]—or the variant Estados-Unidos Mexicanos,[40] all of which have been translated as "United Mexican States". The phrase República Mexicana, "Mexican Republic", was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws.[41]</p>

	<p> View of the Pyramid of the Moon and entrance to the Quetzalpapálotl Palace. During its peak in the Classic era, Teotihuacan dominated the Valley of Mexico and exerted political and cultural influence in other areas, such as in the Petén Basin.</p>
	<p> The earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.[42] Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize, tomato and beans, which produced an agricultural surplus. This enabled the transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BCE.[43]</p>
	<p> In the subsequent formative eras, maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex, and a vigesimal numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area.[44] In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into chiefdoms. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed.[45]</p>
	<p> The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.[46] The formative-era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization.</p>
	<p> In the subsequent pre-classical period, the Maya and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Albán, respectively. During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and the Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script.[47]</p>
	<p> In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuacan, which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas.[48] After the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 CE, competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean languages.</p>

	<p> During the early post-classic, Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chichén Itzá and Mayapán. Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the Mexica established dominance.[clarification needed]</p>
	<p> Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of "Aztec" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, it was adopted by most of the world, including 19th-century Mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.[49]</p>
	<p> The Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were paid.[50]</p>
	<p> The Aztec of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico.[51] The Aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale. Along with this practice, they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield. Their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their Spanish counterparts, whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle.[52] This distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Over the next centuries Mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule.[53]</p>

	<p> The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of 1518. The natives kept "repeating: Colua, Colua, and Mexico, Mexico, but we [explorers] did not know what Colua or Mexico meant", until encountering Montezuma's governor at the mouth of the Rio de las Banderas.[54]:33–36 The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hernán Cortés arrived at the port in Veracruz with ca. 500 conquistadores. After taking control of that city, he moved on to the Aztec capital. In his search for gold and other riches, Cortés decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire.[55]</p>

	<p> When the Spaniards arrived, the ruler of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II, who was later killed. His successor and brother Cuitláhuac took control of the Aztec empire, but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later.[56] Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, among whom smallpox was endemic, the infectious disease ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s. It killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity.[57] Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 Aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million.[58] Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000.[59] The native population declined 80–90% by 1600 to 1–2.5 million. Any population estimate of pre-Columbian Mexico is bound to be a guess but 8–12 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation.</p>
	<p> Smallpox was a devastating disease: it generally killed Aztecs but not Spaniards, who as Europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity.[60] The deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas. At first, the Aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god, but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the Spanish rule.[61] Many of the surviving Aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the Christian god, which resulted in their acceptance of Catholicism and yielding to the Spanish rule throughout Mexico.[62]</p>
	<p> The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain. Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cortés following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Much of the identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico developed during the 300-year colonial period.[63]</p>
	<p> Viceroyalty of New Spain (1521–1821)</p>
	<p> Main article: New Spain</p>

	<p> The capture of Tenochtitlan and refounding of Mexico City in 1521, marked the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which Mexico was known as Nueva España (New Spain). The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec hegemonic empire. Subsequent enlargements, such as the conquest of the Tarascan state, resulted in the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535. The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the Spanish West Indies (The Caribbean), the Spanish East Indies (The Philippines) and Spanish Florida.</p>
	<p> The indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population. The population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases (particularly small pox) introduced during the Columbian Exchange. During the three hundred years of the colonial era, Mexico received some 400,000 to half a million Europeans, 200,000[64] to 250,000 Africans[65] and 40,000 to 120,000 Asians.[66] The 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizos (The Penguin Atlas of World Population History, pp. 291–92).</p>
	<p> Colonial law with Spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the Cabildos) and the Spanish Crown. Whereby upper administrative offices were closed to the natives, even those of pure Spanish blood (criollos). Administration was based on the racial separation of the population among "Republics" of Spaniards, Amerindians and castas, autonomous and directly dependent on the king himself.</p>
	<p> Portrait of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, oil on canvas, 1772.</p>
	<p> The Council of Indies and the mendicant religious orders, which arrived in Mesoamerica as early as 1524, labored to generate capital for the crown of Spain and convert the Amerindian populations to Catholicism. The 1531 Marian apparitions to Saint Juan Diego gave impetus to the evangelization of central Mexico. The Virgin of Guadalupe became a symbol of criollo patriotism[67] and was used by the insurgents that followed Miguel Hidalgo during the War of Independence. Some Crypto-Jewish families emigrated to Mexico to escape the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
	<p> The rich deposits of silver, particularly in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of New Spain. Taxes on silver production became a major source of income for Spain. Other important industries were the haciendas (functioning under the encomienda and repartimiento systems) and mercantile activities in the main cities and ports. Wealth created during the colonial era spurred the development of New Spanish Baroque.</p>
	<p> As a result of its trade links with Asia, the rest of the Americas, Africa and Europe and the profound effect of New World silver, central Mexico was one of the first regions to be incorporated into a globalized economy. Being at the crossroads of trade, people and cultures, Mexico City has been called the "first world city".[68] The Nao de China (Manila Galleons) operated for two and a half centuries and connected New Spain with Asia. From Veracruz, goods would be taken to Atlantic ports in the Americas and Spain. Veracruz was also the main port of entry in mainland New Spain for European goods and immigrants and African slaves. The Camino Real de Tierra Adentro connected Mexico City with the interior of New Spain.</p>
	<p> Guanajuato City became the world's leading silver producer in the 18th century as a result of the veta madre.</p>
	<p> Due to the importance of central New Spain, Mexico boasts various firsts in the Americas, including: first printing shop (1539), first university (1551), first public park (1592) and the first public library (1646). Important artists of the colonial period, include the writers Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, painters Cristóbal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera, and architect Manuel Tolsá. The Academy of San Carlos was the first major school and museum of art in the Americas. Scientist Andrés Manuel del Río Fernández was the first to discover the element vanadium.</p>
	<p> Spanish forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the Chichimeca War (1576–1606), Tepehuán Revolt (1616–1620) and the Pueblo Revolt (1680). In order to protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue only two ports were open to foreign trade— Veracruz on the Atlantic and Acapulco on the Pacific. Among the best known pirate attacks are the 1663 Sack of Campeche and 1683 Attack on Veracruz.</p>
	<p> Many Mexican cultural traits like tequila (first distilled in the 16th century), charreria (17th), mariachi (18th) and Mexican cuisine (a syncretic cuisine) arose during the colonial era.</p>
	<p> War of Independence (1810–1821)</p>
	<p> Main article: Mexican War of Independence</p>
	<p> Depiction of the Abrazo de Acatempan between Agustin de Iturbide, left, and Vicente Guerrero.</p>
	<p> On September 16, 1810, a "loyalist revolt" against the ruling Junta was declared by priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato.[69] The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo, the Spanish viceregal army captain Ignacio Allende, the militia captain Juan Aldama and "La Corregidora" Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in Chihuahua, on July 31, 1811. Following his death, the leadership was assumed by priest José María Morelos, who occupied key southern cities.</p>
	<p> In 1813 the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and, on November 6, signed the "Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America". Morelos was captured and executed on December 22, 1815.</p>
	<p> In subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent an army under the criollo general Agustín de Iturbide against the troops of Vicente Guerrero. Instead, Iturbide approached Guerrero to join forces, and on August 24, 1821 representatives of the Spanish Crown and Iturbide signed the "Treaty of Córdoba" and the "Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire", which recognized the independence of Mexico under the terms of the "Plan of Iguala".</p>
	<p> Mexico’s short recovery after the War of Independence was soon cut short again by the civil wars and institutional instability of the 1850s, which lasted until the government of Porfirio Díaz reestablished conditions that paved the way for economic growth. The conflicts that arose from the mid-1850s had a profound effect because they were widespread and made themselves perceptible in the vast rural areas of the countries, involved clashes between castes, different ethnic groups and haciendas, and entailed a deepening of the political and ideological divisions between republicans and monarchists.[70]</p>

	<p> Agustín de Iturbide became constitutional emperor of the First Mexican Empire in 1822. A revolt against him in 1823 established the United Mexican States. In 1824, a Republican Constitution was drafted and Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the newly born country. Central America, including Chiapas, left the union. In 1829 president Guerrero abolished slavery.[71] The first decades of the post-independence period were marked by economic instability, which led to the Pastry War in 1836. There was constant strife between liberales, supporters of a federal form of government, and conservadores, who proposed a hierarchical form of government.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> During this period, the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in Mexico City, and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering. With limited trade, the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs. Resentment built up from California to Texas. Both the mission system and the presidios had collapsed after the Spanish withdrew from the colony, causing great disruption especially in Alta California and New Mexico. The people in the borderlands had to raise local militias to protect themselves from hostile Native Americans. These areas developed in different directions from the center of the country.[72]</p>
	<p> Wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier, Mexico encouraged immigration into present-day Texas, as they were unable to persuade people from central Mexico to move into those areas. They allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers, who were primarily Protestant English speakers from the United States. Within several years, the Anglos far outnumbered the Tejano in the area. Itinerant traders traveled through the area, working by free market principles. The Tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect, many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end, collaborating with the English-speaking Americans.[72]</p>
	<p> General Antonio López de Santa Anna, a centralist and two-time dictator, approved the Siete Leyes in 1836, a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucatán.</p>

	<p> The 1846 United States annexation of the Republic of Texas and subsequent American military incursion into territory that was part of Coahuila (also claimed by Texas) instigated the Mexican–American War. The war was settled in 1848 via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico was forced to give up more than one-third of its land to the U.S., including Alta California, Santa Fe de Nuevo México and the territory claimed by Texas. A much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico—known as the Gadsden Purchase—occurred in 1854.[73]</p>
	<p> The Caste War of Yucatán, the Maya uprising that began in 1847, was one of the most successful modern Native American revolts.[74][75] Maya rebels, or Cruzob, maintained relatively independent enclaves in the peninsula until the 1930s.[76]</p>
	<p> Dissatisfaction with Santa Anna's return to power led to the liberal "Plan of Ayutla", initiating an era known as La Reforma. The new Constitution drafted in 1857 established a secular state, federalism as the form of government, and several freedoms. As the conservadores refused to recognize it, the Reform War began in 1858, during which both groups had their own governments. The war ended in 1861 with victory by the Liberals, led by president Benito Juárez, who was an ethnic Zapotec.</p>
	<p> In the 1860s Mexico was occupied by France, which established the Second Mexican Empire under the rule of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria with support from the Roman Catholic clergy and the conservadores. The latter switched sides and joined the liberales. Maximilian surrendered, was tried on June 14, 1867, and was executed a few days later on June 19 in Querétaro.</p>
	<p> Porfiriato (1876–1911)</p>
	<p> Main article: Porfiriato</p>
	<p> Porfirio Díaz, a republican general during the French intervention, was elected the 29th president in 1876. The 1880 election was won by Manuel González Flores. Díaz was reelected in 1884 and ruled until 1911. The period, known as the Porfiriato, was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, investments in the arts and sciences and an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications. The period was concurrent with the Gilded Age in the US and Belle Époque in France and was also marked by economic inequality and political repression.</p>
	<p> Díaz ruled with a group of confidants that became known as the científicos ("scientists"). The most influential cientifco was Secretary of Finance José Yves Limantour. The Porfirian regime was influenced by positivism.[77] They rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development.[77] Various iconic buildings and monuments were initiated by Díaz, including the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Palacio de Correos de Mexico, Monumento a la Independencia and the Palacio Legislativo (which became the Monumento a la Revolución).</p>

	<p> Further information: Mexican Revolution</p>
	<p> Francisco I. Madero with Emiliano Zapata, in Cuernavaca during the Mexican Revolution.</p>
	<p> President Díaz announced in 1908 that he would retire in 1911, resulting in the development of new coalitions. But then he ran for reelection anyway and in a show of U.S. support, Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for October 16, 1909, an historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico.[78] Both sides agreed that the disputed Chamizal strip connecting El Paso to Ciudad Juárez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit, but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns.[78]</p>
	<p> On the day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route, and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.[78] Both presidents were unharmed and the summit was held.[78] Díaz was re-elected in 1910, but alleged electoral fraud forced him into exile in France and sparked the 1910 Mexican Revolution, initially led by Francisco I. Madero.</p>
	<p> Madero was elected president but overthrown and murdered in a coup d'état two years later directed by conservative general Victoriano Huerta. That event re-ignited the civil war, involving figures such as Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who formed their own forces. A third force, the constitutional army led by Venustiano Carranza managed to bring an end to the war, and radically amended the 1857 Constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the 1917 Constitution. It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.[79][80]</p>
	<p> Assassinated in 1920, Carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero, Álvaro Obregón, who in turn was succeeded by Plutarco Elías Calles. Obregón was reelected in 1928 but assassinated before he could assume power. Although this period is usually referred to as the Mexican Revolution, it might also be termed a civil war since president Díaz (1909) narrowly escaped assassination and presidents Francisco I. Madero (1913), Venustiano Carranza (1920), Álvaro Obregón (1928), and former revolutionary leaders Emiliano Zapata (1919) and Pancho Villa (1923) all were assassinated during this period.</p>
	<p> One-party rule (1929–2000)</p>
	<p> In 1929, Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), later renamed the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and started a period known as the Maximato, which ended with the election of Lázaro Cárdenas, who implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the Mexican oil expropriation in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. and Anglo-Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company known as Pemex. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by Cárdenas' radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico.</p>
	<p> Students in a burned bus during the protests of 1968.</p>
	<p> Between 1940 and 1980, Mexico remained a poor country but experienced substantial economic growth that some historians call the "Mexican miracle".[81] Although the economy continued to flourish for some, social inequality remained a factor of discontent. Moreover, the PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as 'Mexico's dirty war'[82] (see the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre,[83] which claimed the life of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and as many as 800 protesters).[84]</p>
	<p> Electoral reforms and high oil prices followed the administration of Luis Echeverría,[85][86] mismanagement of these revenues led to inflation and exacerbated the 1982 Crisis. That year, oil prices plunged, interest rates soared, and the government defaulted on its debt. President Miguel de la Madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.</p>
	<p> In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in PRI's monopolistic position. In Baja California, Ernesto Ruffo Appel was elected as governor. In 1988, alleged electoral fraud prevented the leftist candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning the national presidential elections, giving Carlos Salinas de Gortari the presidency and leading to massive protests in Mexico City.[87]</p>

	<p> Salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate, controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994. The same day, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization.</p>
	<p> In 1994, Salinas was succeeded by Ernesto Zedillo, followed by the Mexican peso crisis and a $50 billion IMF bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by President Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.[88]</p>
	<p> Contemporary Mexico</p>
	<p> In 2000, after 71 years, the PRI lost a presidential election to Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action Party (PAN). In the 2006 presidential election, Felipe Calderón from the PAN was declared the winner, with a very narrow margin over leftist politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). López Obrador, however, contested the election and pledged to create an "alternative government".[89]</p>
	<p> After twelve years, in 2012, the PRI won the Presidency again with the election of Enrique Peña Nieto, the governor of the State of Mexico from 2005–2011. However, he won with only a plurality of about 38%, and did not have a legislative majority.[90]</p>
	<p> Geography</p>
	<p> Main article: Geography of Mexico</p>
	<p> Topographic map of Mexico.</p>
	<p> Mexico map of Köppen climate classification.</p>
	<p> Mexico is located between latitudes 14° and 33°N, and longitudes 86° and 119°W in the southern portion of North America.[citation needed] Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central America.[91] Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.[92]</p>
	<p> Mexico's total area is 1,972,550 km2 (761,606 sq mi), making it the world's 14th largest country by total area, and includes approximately 6,000 km2 (2,317 sq mi) of islands in the Pacific Ocean (including the remote Guadalupe Island and the Revillagigedo Islands), Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Gulf of California. From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over 2,000 mi (3,219 km) in length.</p>
	<p> On its north, Mexico shares a 3,141 km (1,952 mi) border with the United States. The meandering Río Bravo del Norte (known as the Rio Grande in the United States) defines the border from Ciudad Juárez east to the Gulf of Mexico. A series of natural and artificial markers delineate the United States-Mexican border west from Ciudad Juárez to the Pacific Ocean. Donald Trump made the construction of a border wall (on the U.S. side) an element of his 2016 presidential campaign. On its south, Mexico shares an 871 km (541 mi) border with Guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) border with Belize.</p>
	<p> Mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental, which are the extension of the Rocky Mountains from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country is crossed by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoacán to Oaxaca.[93]</p>
	<p> As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Pico de Orizaba (5,700 m or 18,701 ft), Popocatepetl (5,462 m or 17,920 ft) and Iztaccihuatl (5,286 m or 17,343 ft) and the Nevado de Toluca (4,577 m or 15,016 ft). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: Toluca, Greater Mexico City and Puebla.[93]</p>
	<p> Climate</p>
	<p> Main article: Climate of Mexico</p>
	<p> The Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems.</p>
	<p> Areas south of the 24th parallel with elevations up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft) (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucatán Peninsula), have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28 °C (75.2 to 82.4 °F). Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a 5 °C (9 °F) difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the 24th parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24 °C or 68.0 to 75.2 °F) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.</p>
	<p> Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from 16 to 18 °C or 60.8 to 64.4 °F) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.</p>
	<p> Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000 mm (78.7 in) of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like Monterrey, Hermosillo, and Mexicali experience temperatures of 40 °C (104 °F) or more in summer. In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach 50 °C (122 °F) or more.</p>
	<p> In 2012, Mexico passed a comprehensive climate change bill, a first in the developing world, that has set a goal for the country to generate 35% of its energy from clean energy sources by 2024, and to cut emissions by 50% by 2050, from the level found in 2000.[94][95] During the 2016 North American Leaders' Summit, the target of 50% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2025 was announced.[96]</p>

With over 200,000 different species, Mexico is home of 10–12% of the world's biodiversity.[98] Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species.[99] Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species.[100] Approximately 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislations.[100]</p>
	<p> In 2002, Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world, second only to Brazil.[101] The government has taken another initiative in the late 1990s to broaden the people's knowledge, interest and use of the country's esteemed biodiversity, through the Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad.</p>
	<p> In Mexico, 170,000 square kilometres (65,637 sq mi) are considered "Protected Natural Areas." These include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems), 67 national parks, 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).[98]</p>
	<p> The discovery of the Americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used food crops and edible plants. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: chocolate, avocado, tomato, maize, vanilla, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, many varieties of beans, and an even greater variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like Nahuatl.</p>
	<p> Because of its high biodiversity Mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies.[102] The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber "Barbasco" (Dioscorea composita) which has a high content of diosgenin, revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills.[103]</p>
	<p> Government and politics</p>
	<p> Government</p>
	<p> Main article: Federal government of Mexico</p>
	<p> Enrique Peña Nieto, President of Mexico.</p>
	<p> The United Mexican States are a federation whose government is representative, democratic and republican based on a presidential system according to the 1917 Constitution. The constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the municipal governments. According to the constitution, all constituent states of the federation must have a republican form of government composed of three branches: the executive, represented by a governor and an appointed cabinet, the legislative branch constituted by a unicameral congress and the judiciary, which will include a state Supreme Court of Justice. They also have their own civil and judicial codes.</p>
	<p> The federal legislature is the bicameral Congress of the Union, composed of the Senate of the Republic and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, imposes taxes, approves the national budget and international treaties, and ratifies diplomatic appointments.[104]</p>
	<p> The federal Congress, as well as the state legislatures, are elected by a system of parallel voting that includes plurality and proportional representation.[105] The Chamber of Deputies has 500 deputies. Of these, 300 are elected by plurality vote in single-member districts (the federal electoral districts) and 200 are elected by proportional representation with closed party lists[106] for which the country is divided into five electoral constituencies.[107] The Senate is made up of 128 senators. Of these, 64 senators (two for each state and two for the Federal District) are elected by plurality vote in pairs; 32 senators are the first minority or first-runner up (one for each state and one for the Federal District), and 32 are elected by proportional representation from national closed party lists.[106]</p>
	<p> The executive is the President of the United Mexican States, who is the head of state and government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Mexican military forces. The President also appoints the Cabinet and other officers. The President is responsible for executing and enforcing the law, and has the power to veto bills.[108]</p>
	<p> Site of the Supreme Court of Justice</p>
	<p> The highest organ of the judicial branch of government is the Supreme Court of Justice, the national supreme court, which has eleven judges appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Supreme Court of Justice interprets laws and judges cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Federal Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary.[109]</p>
	<p> Politics</p>
	<p> Main article: Politics of Mexico</p>
	<p> Three parties have historically been the dominant parties in Mexican politics: the National Action Party: a conservative party founded in 1939 and belonging to the Christian Democrat Organization of America;[110] the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a center-left party and member of Socialist International[111] that was founded in 1929 to unite all the factions of the Mexican Revolution and held an almost hegemonic power in Mexican politics since then; the Party of the Democratic Revolution: a left-wing party,[112] founded in 1989 as the successor of the coalition of socialists and liberal parties.</p>
	<p> Law enforcement</p>
	<p> Main article: Law enforcement in Mexico</p>
	<p> Federal Police headquarters in Mexico City</p>
	<p> Public security is enacted at the three levels of government, each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities. Local and state police departments are primarily in charge of law enforcement, whereas the Mexican Federal Police are in charge of specialized duties. All levels report to the Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (Secretary of Public Security). The General Attorney's Office (Procuraduría General de la República, PGR) is the executive power's agency in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level, mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking,[113] espionage, and bank robberies.[114] The PGR operates the Federal Investigations Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigación, AFI) an investigative and preventive agency.[115]</p>
	<p> While the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods.[116] The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.[117] By law, all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and humane treatment; however, the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problems.[116]</p>
	<p> Despite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud, most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens.[116] The Global Integrity Index which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia.[118] In 2008, president Calderón proposed a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress of the Union, which included oral trials, the presumption of innocence for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crime—until then a prerogative of special police units—and several other changes intended to speed up trials.[119]</p>
	<p> Crime</p>
	<p> Main articles: Crime in Mexico and Mexican Drug War</p>
	<p> Drug cartels are a major concern in Mexico.[120] Mexico's drug war has left over 60,000 dead and perhaps another 20,000 missing.[121] The Mexican drug cartels have as many as 100,000 members.[122] The Mexican government's National Geography and Statistics Institute estimated that there were 41,563 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012.[123]</p>
	<p> President Felipe Calderón made abating organized crime one of the top priorities of his administration by deploying military personnel to cities where drug cartels operate. This move was criticized by the opposition parties and the National Human Rights Commission for escalating the violence, but its effects have been positively evaluated by the US State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as having obtained "unprecedented results" with "many important successes".[124]</p>
	<p> Since President Felipe Calderón launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006, more than 28,000 alleged criminals have been killed.[125][126] Of the total drug-related violence 4% are innocent people,[127] mostly by-passers and people trapped in between shootings; 90% accounts for criminals and 6% for military personnel and police officers.[127] In October 2007, President Calderón and US president George W. Bush announced the Mérida Initiative, a plan of law enforcement cooperation between the two countries.[128]</p>
	<p> Foreign relations</p>
	<p> President Peña Nieto with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Barack Obama of the United States at the 2016 North American Leaders' Summit.</p>
	<p> Main article: Foreign relations of Mexico</p>
	<p> The foreign relations of Mexico are directed by the President of Mexico[129] and managed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[130] The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations.[129] Since the 1930s, the Estrada Doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles.[131]</p>
	<p> Mexico is one of the founding members of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations,[132] the Organization of American States,[133] the Organization of Ibero-American States,[134] the OPANAL[135] and the Rio Group.[136] In 2008, Mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the United Nations regular budget.[137] In addition, it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until Chile gained full membership in 2010.[138][139]</p>
	<p> Mexico is considered a regional power[140][141] hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20. In addition, since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods[142] with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.[143]</p>
	<p> After the War of Independence, the relations of Mexico were focused primarily on the United States, its northern neighbor, largest trading partner,[144] and the most powerful actor in hemispheric and world affairs.[145] Mexico supported the Cuban government since its establishment in the early 1960s,[146] the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the late 1970s,[147] and leftist revolutionary groups in El Salvador during the 1980s.[148] Felipe Calderón's administration put a greater emphasis on relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.[149]</p>
	<p> Military</p>
	<p> Main article: Mexican Armed Forces</p>
	<p> A Mexican Navy Eurocopter</p>
	<p> The Mexican Armed Forces have two branches: the Mexican Army (which includes the Mexican Air Force), and the Mexican Navy. The Mexican Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including facilities for design, research, and testing of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels, defense systems and electronics;[150][151] military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.[152]</p>
	<p> Mexican built Sierra-class corvettes</p>
	<p> In recent years, Mexico has improved its training techniques, military command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more self-reliant in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing its own arms,[153] missiles,[151] aircraft,[154] vehicles, heavy weaponry, electronics,[150] defense systems,[150] armor, heavy military industrial equipment and heavy naval vessels.[155] Since the 1990s, when the military escalated its role in the war on drugs, increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, aircraft, helicopters, digital war-fighting technologies,[150] urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transport.[156]</p>
	<p> Mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons, but abandoned this possibility with the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.[157] In 1970, Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully refined weapons grade uranium[158][not in citation given] which is used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in April 2010, Mexico agreed to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the United States.[159][160]</p>
	<p> Historically, Mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts,[161] with the exception of World War II. However, in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution in order to allow the Mexican Army, Air Force or Navy to collaborate with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions, or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it.[162]</p>
	<p> Administrative divisions</p>
	<p> Main articles: Administrative divisions of Mexico, States of Mexico, and Municipalities of Mexico</p>
	<p> See also: List of regions of Mexico</p>
	<p> The United Mexican States are a federation of 31 free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over the Federal District and other territories.</p>
	<p> Each state has its own constitution, congress, and a judiciary, and its citizens elect by direct voting a governor for a six-year term, and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.[163]</p>
	<p> The Federal District is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state, and as such, has more limited local rule than the nation's states.[164]</p>
	<p> The states are divided into municipalities, the smallest administrative political entity in the country, governed by a mayor or municipal president (presidente municipal), elected by its residents by plurality.[165]</p>
	<p> Economy</p>
	<p> Main article: Economy of Mexico</p>
	<p> See also: Economic history of Mexico</p>
	<p> A proportional representation of Mexico's exports. The country has the most complex economy in Latin America.</p>
	<p> Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity. GDP annual average growth for the period of 1995–2002 was 5.1%.[86] Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at US $2.2602 trillion in 2015, and $1.3673 trillion in nominal exchange rates.[166] Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US $18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's Gross National Income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US $1,830.392 billion,[167] which lead to the highest income per capita in the region at $14,400.[168] Mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[169] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[170] Furthermore, after the 2008–2009 recession, the economy grew an average of 3.32 percent per year from 2010 to 2014.</p>
	<p> From the late 1990s onwards, the majority of the population has been part of the growing middle class.[171] But from 2004 to 2008 the portion of the population who received less than half of the median income has risen from 17% to 21% and the absolute levels of poverty rose from 2006 to 2010, with a rise in persons living in extreme or moderate poverty rising from 35 to 46% (52 million persons).[172][173] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations, and the literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.[174]</p>
	<p> Among the OECD countries, Mexico has the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile – although it has been falling over the last decade, being only one of few countries in which this is the case.[175] The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average – both in absolute and relative numbers.[172]</p>
	<p> According to a 2008 UN report the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403.[176] Daily minimum wages are set annually by law and determined by zone; $67.29 Mexican pesos ($5.13 USD) in Zone A and $63.77 Mexican pesos ($4.86 USD) in Zone B.[177]</p>
	<p> The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[178] The Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[178] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[178]</p>
	<p> Mexico produces the most automobiles of any North American nation.[179] The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities.[180] The "Big Three" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s.[181] In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen.[180] In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 alone, more than $10 billion in investment was committed. Kia Motors in August 2014 announced plans for a $1 billion factory in Nuevo León. At the time Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a $1.4 billion plant near Puebla, while BMW was planning a $1-billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosí. Additionally, Audi began building a $1.3 billion factory near Puebla in 2013.[182]</p>
	<p> The domestic car industry is represented by DINA S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962,[183] and the new Mastretta company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car.[184] In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports.[13] During the first three quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with Mexico.[185] In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest holder of US debt.[186] The commercial and financial dependence on the US is a cause for concern.[187]</p>
	<p> The remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States account for 0.2% of Mexico's GDP[188] which was equal to US$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign income after oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.[189] According to Mexico's central bank, remittances in 2008 amounted to $25bn.[190]</p>
	<p> Major players in the broadcasting industry are Televisa, the largest Spanish media company in the Spanish-speaking world,[191] and TV Azteca.</p>
	<p> Communications</p>
	<p> Main article: Telecommunications in Mexico</p>
	<p> Morelos 3, the latest addition to the Morelos Satellite System</p>
	<p> The telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (Teléfonos de México), privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are Axtel and Maxcom. Because of Mexican orography, providing a landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.[192] The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through Cofetel (Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones).</p>
	<p> The Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.[192] Mexican satellites are operated by Satélites Mexicanos (Satmex), a private company, leader in Latin America and servicing both North and South America.[193] It offers broadcast, telephone and telecommunication services to 37 countries in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. Through business partnerships Satmex provides high-speed connectivity to ISPs and Digital Broadcast Services.[194] Satmex maintains its own satellite fleet with most of the fleet being designed and built in Mexico.</p>
	<p> The use of radio, television, and Internet in Mexico is prevalent.[195] There are approximately 1,410 radio broadcast stations and 236 television stations (excluding repeaters).[192] Major players in the broadcasting industry are Televisa—the largest media company in the Spanish-speaking world[191]—and TV Azteca.</p>

	<p> Energy production in Mexico is managed by state-owned companies: the Federal Commission of Electricity and Pemex.</p>
	<p> Pemex, the public company in charge of exploration, extraction, transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals, is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, making US $86 billion in sales a year.[197][198][199] Mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, with 3.7 million barrels per day.[200] In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.[180]</p>
	<p> The largest hydro plant in Mexico is the 2,400 MW Manuel Moreno Torres Dam in Chicoasén, Chiapas, in the Grijalva River. This is the world's fourth most productive hydroelectric plant.[201]</p>
	<p> Mexico is the country with the world's third largest solar potential.[202] The country's gross solar potential is estimated at 5kWh/m2 daily, which corresponds to 50 times national electricity generation.[203] Currently, there is over 1 million square meters of solar thermal panels[204] installed in Mexico, while in 2005, there were 115,000 square meters of solar PV (photo-voltaic). It is expected that in 2012 there will be 1,8 million square meters of installed solar thermal panels.[204]</p>
	<p> The project named SEGH-CFE 1, located in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, Northwest of Mexico, will have capacity of 46.8 MW from an array of 187,200 solar panels when complete in 2013.[205] All of the electricity will be sold directly to the CFE and absorbed into the utility's transmission system for distribution throughout their existing network. At an installed capacity of 46.8 MWp, when complete in 2013, the project will be the first utility scale project of its kind in Mexico and the largest solar project of any kind in Latin America.</p>

	<p> The National Autonomous University of Mexico was officially established in 1910,[206] and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico.[207] UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.[208] Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936),[209] were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973.[210] In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.</p>
	<p> In 1995, the Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.[211] Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.[212]</p>
	<p> In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.[213] It was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust.</p>
	<p> Tourism</p>
	<p> Main article: Tourism in Mexico</p>
	<p> The Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios atop the Great Pyramid of Cholula with Popocatépetl visible in the background has become an iconic image of Mexico.</p>
	<p> Mexico has traditionally been among the most visited countries in the world according to the World Tourism Organization and it is the most visited country in the Americas, after the United States. The most notable attractions are the Mesoamerican ruins, cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts. The nation's wide range of climates, from temperate to tropical, and unique culture – a fusion of the European and the Mesoamerican – make Mexico an attractive destination. The peak tourism seasons in the country are during December and the mid-Summer, with brief surges during the week before Easter and Spring break, when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations for college students from the United States.</p>
	<p> As of 2011, Mexico had the 23rd highest income from tourism in the world, and the highest in Latin America.[214] The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and Canada followed by Europe and Asia. A smaller number also come from other Latin American countries.[215] In the 2011 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index report, Mexico was ranked 43rd in the world, which was 4th in the Americas .[216]</p>
	<p> The Caribbean state of Quintana Roo is particularly known for beach tourism. Major destinations include Cancún, Cozumel and the Riviera Maya.</p>
	<p> The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sun bathers and other visitors. According to national law, the entirety of the coastlines are under federal ownership, that is, all beaches in the country are public. On the Yucatán peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Cancún, especially among university students during spring break. Just offshore is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-Há. A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of Tulum. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side Mayan ruins.</p>
	<p> On the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of Acapulco. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.</p>
	<p> At the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing.[217] Further north along the Sea of Cortés is the Bahía de La Concepción, another beach town known for its sports fishing. Closer to the United States border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.</p>

	<p> The Baluarte Bridge is the highest cable-stayed bridge in the world, the fifth-highest bridge overall and the highest bridge in the Americas.</p>
	<p> The roadway network in Mexico is extensive and all areas in the country are covered by it.[218] The roadway network in Mexico has an extent of 366,095 km (227,481 mi),[219] of which 116,802 km (72,577 mi) are paved,[220] making it the largest paved-roadway network in Latin America.[221] Of these, 10,474 km (6,508 mi) are multi-lane expressways: 9,544 km (5,930 mi) are four-lane highways and the rest have 6 or more lanes.[220]</p>
	<p> Mexico was one of the first Latin American countries to promote railway development,[116] and the network covers 30,952 km (19,233 mi).[195] The Secretary of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco.[222][223] The train, which will travel at 300 kilometres per hour (190 miles per hour),[224] will allow passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2 hours.[224] The whole project was projected to cost 240 billion pesos, or about 25 billion US$[222] and is being paid for jointly by the Mexican government and the local private sector including the wealthiest man in the world, Mexico's billionaire business tycoon Carlos Slim.[225] The government of the state of Yucatán is also funding the construction of a high speed line connecting the cities of Cozumel to Mérida and Chichen Itza and Cancún.[226]</p>
	<p> Mexico has 233 airports with paved runways; of these, 35 carry 97% of the passenger traffic.[195] The Mexico City International Airport remains the largest in Latin America and the 44th largest in the world[227] transporting 21 million passengers a year.[228]</p>

	<p> Among the achievements is a significant increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas (88% to 93%) as well as in rural areas (50% to 74%) between 1990 and 2010. Additionally, a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation (64% to 85%) was observed in the same period. Other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure with a National Water Commission as its apex institution; and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as Aguas y Drenaje de Monterrey.</p>
	<p> The challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country; inadequate water service quality (drinking water quality; 55% of Mexicans receiving water only intermittently according to results of the 2000 census); poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities (with an average level of non-revenue water of 51% in 2003); an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 2006); and still inadequate access in rural areas. In addition to on-going investments to expand access, the government has embarked on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment.</p>
	<p> Demographics</p>
	<p> Main article: Demographics of Mexico</p>
	<p> The 2010 Census[229] showed a population of 112,336,538, making it the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.[230] Between 2005 and 2010, the Mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year, up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005.</p>
	<p> Prior to 2015, the Mexican government did not ask for the ethnicity nor race of its citizens (last doing so in 1921). The number of indígenas (indigenous peoples) was defined narrowly to speakers of one of Mexico's 62 indigenous languages or connections to established indigenous communities. As a result, the 2010 census found that 14.86% of the population was indigenous.[231] However, beginning with the 2015 inter-census estimate, the government now asks whether an individual self-identifies as indigenous (21.5% of the population) and/or Afro-Mexican (1.2% of the population).[232] These categories are not exclusionary and an individual can indicate both indigenous and afro-descendant heritage. No other groups (such as mestizos, whites or Asian-descendants) are quantified by the government.</p>
	<p> As of 2015, the foreign-born population was 1,007,063.[233] The majority of these individuals were born in the United States and Mexico is home to the largest number of U.S. citizens abroad.[234] After Americans the largest immigrant groups are Guatemalans, Spaniards and Colombians. Besides the Spanish, large immigrant-descended groups are the French, Germans, Lebanese and Chinese. Mexico is the largest source of immigration to the United States.[235] Some 11.6 million residents of the United States have Mexican citizenship as of 2014.[236]</p>

	<p> Depictions of the three main castas resulting from miscegenation of Europeans, Africans and indigenous Americans. Produced during the Age of Enlightenment, the pinturas de castas attempted to "rationally categorize" the racial diversity of Mexico, but some sets were also manifestations of early national self-pride. Wealth and order depicted through clothing, mercantile goods and religious symbols, challenged preconceived notions of New Spain in Europe.[237]</p>
	<p> Mexico is ethnically diverse; the various indigenous peoples, whites, afro-descendants and mestizos are united under a single national identity.[238] The core part of Mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures, primarily European culture and indigenous cultures, in a process known as mestizaje, alluding to the mixed biological origins of the majority of Mexicans.[238][239] Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos (promoter of the cosmic race) and Manuel Gamio (promoter of indigenismo) were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.[240]</p>
	<p> In 1810, towards the end of the Colonial era, the population of Mexico was estimated to be about 6 million (based on the 1793 Revillagigedo Census and the 1803 estimate by geographer Alexander Humboldt and 1810 estimate by royal accountant Francisco Navarro y Noriega). From these population estimates, anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán approximated the following in regards to race and ethnicity: there were some 15,000 peninsulares (expelled after independence), less than 10,000 Africans (mostly enslaved, legally freed in 1829), more than a million "Euromestizos" (criollos and individuals of primarily European descent, such as castizos), some 700,000 "Indomestizos" (individuals of significant indigenous descent), some 600,000 "Afromestizos" (individuals of significant African descent, such as mulatos) and some 3.7 million indigenous peoples.[241] Mexico does not ask about race in its census in part because it eliminated the legal basis of the Colonial caste system (based on race and birth) after independence.</p>
	<p> A large majority of Mexicans have been classified as "Mestizos" (between 50% to 67% according to the Encyclopædia Britannica).[242] In modern Mexico, the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era, resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity. The term is not in wide use in Mexican society, although often used in literature about Mexican social identities. Since the term carries a variety of socio-cultural, economic, racial and biological meanings, it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification and was abandoned in Mexican censuses.[116][243] Various genetic studies have found that Mexico's population is not uniform in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation.[244][245][246] According to the country's Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, on average mestizos of primarily European ancestry predominate in the north while mestizos from the southern region have predominately indigenous ancestry.[246] Mestizos from the center of the country have a more even contribution from Europeans and Natives, while the highest African contribution was found in the southwest and Veracruz.[246] In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo is even used about Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the Caste War of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos.[247] In Chiapas the word "Ladino" is used instead of mestizo.[248]</p>
	<p> Estimates of the number of European-descended whites range from 10% to 20% according to the Encyclopædia Britannica.[242] The numbers very since the criteria to define mestizo might be different from study to study and in Mexico some number of white people have been historically classified as mestizos since the Mexican government defined ethnicity on cultural standards as opposed to racial ones.[249] During the colonial and independent era, most of the European migration into Mexico was Spanish. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-Spanish Europeans immigrated to the country. However, at its height, the total immigrant population in Mexico never exceeded two percent of the total.[250] Some of these immigrants, along with non-European immigrants, were forced out of the country as a result of the Mexican Revolution. Mexico's northern regions have the greatest European population and admixture. According to the last racial census Mexico took, which was in 1921,[251] there were no states in Mexico that had a majority "white" population, and in virtually every state in the north Mestizos were the largest population group.[251] The only state where "whites" outnumbered Mestizos was Sonora, in which "whites" composed 41.85% of the population, and Mestizos 40.38%.[251]</p>
	<p> The absolute indigenous population of Mexico (26,694,928 individuals as of 2015)[232] is growing, but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling.[252] The majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central and southern states, primarily in rural areas. Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of "usos y costumbres", which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are:[253] Yucatán at 59%, Quintana Roo 39% and Campeche 27%, chiefly Maya; Oaxaca with 48% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas at 28%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo 24%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla 19%, and Guerrero 17%, mostly Nahua peoples and the states of San Luis Potosí and Veracruz both home to a population that is 15% indigenous, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.[254] All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average. In all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality, in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%. The indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. However, 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary, compared to 20% for the national average. Many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing.[254]</p>
	<p> The Afro-Mexican population (1,381,853 individuals as of 2015)[232] is an ethnic group made up of descendants of Colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-Saharan African descent. Mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 Africans were taken there, primarily in the 17th century. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past; it passively eliminated the African ancestors and contributions. Most of the African-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European/indigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census, 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 9.3% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language.[255] The states with the highest self-report of Afro-Mexicans were Guerrero (6.5% of the population), Oaxaca (4.95%) and Veracruz (3.28%).[256] Afro-Mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and Costa Chica of Guerrero.</p>
	<p> Smaller ethnic groups in Mexico include South and East Asians, present since the colonial era. During the colonial era Asians were termed Chino (regardless of ethnicity), and arrived as merchants, artisans and slaves.[257] The largest group were Filipinos and some 200,000 Mexicans can trace Filipino ancestry.[258] Modern Asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century, the Chinese were the second largest immigrant group.[259] During the early 20th century, a substantial number of Arabs (mostly Christians)[260] began arriving from the crumbling Ottoman Empire. The largest group were the Lebanese and an estimated 400,000 Mexicans have some Lebanese ancestry.[261]</p>
	<p> Languages</p>
	<p> Main article: Languages of Mexico</p>
	<p> The country has the largest Spanish-speaking population in the world with almost a third of all Spanish native speakers.[230][262]</p>
	<p> Almost all of the Mexican population speaks Spanish, 99.3% according to the latest census;[263] nonetheless around 5.4% still speaks an indigenous language besides Spanish. The indigenous languages with the most speakers are Nahuatl, spoken by approximately 1.45 million people,[264] Yukatek Maya spoken by some 750,000 people and the Mixtec[265] and Zapotec languages,[266] each spoken by more than 400,000 people.</p>
	<p> The National Institute of Indigenous Languages INALI recognizes 68 linguistic groups and some 364 different specific varieties of indigenous languages.[267] Since the promulgation of the Law of Indigenous Linguistic Rights in 2003, these languages have had status as national languages, with equal validity with Spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken.[268]</p>
	<p> In addition to the indigenous languages, other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations, such as the 80,000 German-speaking Mennonites in Mexico,[269] and 5,000 speakers of the Chipilo dialect of the Venetian language spoken in Chipilo, Puebla.</p>
	<p> Arabic is the most commonly spoken foreign language in Mexico.[270]</p>

	<p> The 2010 census by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) gave Roman Catholicism as the main religion, with 83% of the population, while 10% (10,924,103) belong to other Christian denominations, including Evangelicals (5%); Pentecostals (1.6%); other Protestant or Reformed (0.7%); Jehovah's Witnesses (1.4%); Seventh-day Adventists (0.6%); and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (0.3%).[2] 172,891 (or less than 0.2% of the total) belonged to other, non-Christian religions; 4.7% declared having no religion; 2.7% were unspecified.[2]</p>
	<p> The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a major Christian pilgrimage site, with some twenty million annual visitors.[273]</p>
	<p> The 92,924,489[2] Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after Brazil's.[274] 47% percent of them attend church services weekly.[275] The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is celebrated on December 12 and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.[276]</p>
	<p> The 2010 census reported 314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[2] though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members.[277] About 25% of registered members attend a weekly sacrament service although this can fluctuate up and down.[278]</p>
	<p> The presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several Conversos.[279] According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico.[2] Islam in Mexico is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans, while there is also a small community of Muslims among indigenous Mexicans around the San Cristóbal de las Casas area in Chiapas.[280][281] In the 2010 census 18,185 Mexicans reported belonging to an Eastern religion,[2] a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population.</p>
	<p> Women</p>
	<p> Further information: Women in Mexico</p>
	<p> Until the twentieth century, Mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural women's status defined within the context of the family and local community. With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages. Roman Catholicism in Mexico has shaped societal attitudes about women's social role, emphasizing the role of women as nurturers of the family, with the Virgin Mary as a model. Marianismo has been an ideal, with women's role as being within the family under the authority of men. In the twentieth century, Mexican women made great strides toward toward a more equal legal and social status. In 1953, women in Mexico were granted the vote in national elections.</p>
	<p> Mexican women face discrimination and at times harassment from the machismo population. Although women in Mexico are making big advancements they are faced with the traditional expectations of being the head of the household. Researcher Margarita Valdés noted that while there are few inequalities enforced by law or policy in Mexico, there are gender inequalities perpetuated by social structures and Mexican cultural expectations that limit the capabilities of Mexican women.[282]</p>
	<p> As of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world [283] The prevalence of domestic violence against women in Mexican marital relationships varies at between 30 and 60 percent of relationships.[284] The remains of the victims were frequently mutilated.[285] According to a 1997 study, domestic abuse in Mexican culture "is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women's dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem, sustained by ideologies of romantic love, by family structure and residential arrangements."[286] The perpetrators are often the boyfriend, father-in-law, ex-husbands or husbands but only 1.6% of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing.[285]</p>
	<p> Culture</p>
	<p> Main article: Culture of Mexico</p>
	<p> Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera in 1932.</p>
	<p> Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.</p>
	<p> The Porfirian era (el Porfiriato), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has had its foundation in the mestizaje, of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication La Raza Cósmica (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the mestizo) not only biologically but culturally as well.[287]</p>
	<p> Literature</p>
	<p> Main articles: Mexican literature and Mesoamerican literature</p>
	<p> Mexican literature has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is Nezahualcoyotl. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of Mesoamerica. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Juana Inés de la Cruz.</p>
	<p> Other writers include Alfonso Reyes, José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), Renato Leduc, Carlos Monsiváis, Elena Poniatowska, Mariano Azuela ("Los de abajo") and Juan Rulfo ("Pedro Páramo"). Bruno Traven wrote "Canasta de cuentos mexicanos" (Mexican tales basket), "El tesoro de la Sierra Madre" (Treasure of the Sierra Madre).</p>
	<p> Visual arts</p>
	<p> See also: Mexican art</p>
	<p> The Palacio de Bellas Artes is the preeminent arts museum in Mexico.</p>
	<p> Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, Federico Cantú Garza, Frida Kahlo, Juan O'Gorman, José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader Lenin.[288] Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican National Palace and the Palace of Fine Arts.</p>
	<p> Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.[citation needed] Spanish Colonial architecture is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain.[citation needed] Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.</p>

	<p> Actress Dolores del Río, Hollywood star in the 1920s and 1930s and prominent figure of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
	<p> Mexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. Maria Candelaria (1943) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director Luis Buñuel realized in Mexico, between 1947 and 1965 some of him master pieces like Los Olvidados (1949) and Viridiana (1961). Famous actors and actresses from this period include María Félix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del Río, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.</p>
	<p> More recently, films such as Como agua para chocolate (1992), Cronos (1993), Y tu mamá también (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognized, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores perros, Babel, Birdman, The Revenant), Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gravity), Guillermo del Toro, Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and photographer Emmanuel Lubezki are some of the most known present-day film makers.</p>
	<p> Some Mexican actors have achieved recognition as Hollywood stars. These include Ramon Novarro, Dolores del Río, Lupe Vélez, Gilbert Roland, Anthony Quinn, Katy Jurado, Ricardo Montalbán and Salma Hayek</p>
	<p> Media</p>
	<p> Further information: Mexican television and List of newspapers in Mexico</p>
	<p> There are two major television companies in Mexico that own the four primary networks that broadcast to 75% of the population. They are Televisa, which owns the Canal de las Estrellas and Canal 5 networks, and TV Azteca, which owns the Azteca 7 and Azteca Trece networks. Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world's largest Spanish-language media network.[289] Grupo Multimedios is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States. The telenovelas are very traditional in Mexico and are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez and Thalía.</p>
	<p> Music</p>

	<p> Mariachi at the Festival del Mariachi, Charrería y Tequila in San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco. Mariachi was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2011.</p>
	<p> Mexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes mariachi, banda, norteño, ranchera and corridos; on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as pop, rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain.</p>
	<p> Some well-known Mexican singers are Thalía, Luis Miguel, Juan Gabriel, Alejandro Fernández, Julieta Venegas, Gloria Trevi and Paulina Rubio. Mexican singers of traditional music are: Lila Downs, Susana Harp, Jaramar, GEO Meneses and Alejandra Robles. Popular groups are Café Tacuba, Caifanes, Molotov and Maná, among others. Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), Mexican rock has seen widespread growth both domestically and internationally.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> According to the Sistema Nacional de Fomento Musical, there are between 120 and 140 youth orchestras affiliated to this federal agency from all federal states.[citation needed] Some states, through their state agencies in charge of culture and the arts—Ministry or Secretary or Institute or Council of Culture, or in some cases the Secretary of Education or the State University—sponsor the activities of a professional symphony orchestra or philharmonic crchestra so all citizens can have access to this artistic expression from the field of classical music. Mexico City is the most intense hub of this activity, hosting 12 professional orchestras sponsored by different agencies such as the National Institute of Fine Arts, the Secretary of Culture of the Federal District, The National University, the National Polytechnic Institute, a Delegación Política (Coyoacán) and private ventures.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Cuisine</p>
	<p> Main article: Mexican cuisine</p>
	<p> Mole sauce, which has dozens of varieties across the Republic, is seen as a symbol of Mexicanidad[290] and is considered Mexico's national dish.[290]</p>
	<p> Chile en nogada, due to the dish's incorporation of red, white and green, is popularly consumed during the celebrations of the</p>
	<p> Grito de Dolores.[291]</p>
	<p> Mexican cuisine is known for its intense and varied flavors, colorful decoration, and variety of spices. Most of today's Mexican food is based on pre-Columbian traditions, including Aztec and Maya, combined with culinary trends introduced by Spanish colonists.</p>
	<p> The conquistadores eventually combined their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions with the native pre-Columbian food, including maize, tomato, vanilla, avocado, guava, papaya, pineapple, chili pepper, beans, squash, sweet potato, peanut, and turkey.</p>
	<p> Mexican food varies by region, because of local climate and geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants and because these different populations were influenced by the Spaniards in varying degrees. The north of Mexico is known for its beef, goat and ostrich production and meat dishes, in particular the well-known Arrachera cut.</p>
	<p> Central Mexico's cuisine is largely made up of influences from the rest of the country, but also has its authentics, such as barbacoa, pozole, menudo, tamales, and carnitas.</p>
	<p> Southeastern Mexico, on the other hand, is known for its spicy vegetable and chicken-based dishes. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico also has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Veal is common in the Yucatan. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, in particular à la veracruzana.</p>
	<p> In modern times, other cuisines of the world have become very popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, sushi in Mexico is often made with a variety of sauces based on mango or tamarind, and very often served with serrano-chili-blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero and chipotle peppers</p>
	<p> The most internationally recognized dishes include chocolate, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, burritos, tamales and mole among others. Regional dishes include mole poblano, chiles en nogada and chalupas from Puebla; cabrito and machaca from Monterrey, cochinita pibil from Yucatán, Tlayudas from Oaxaca, as well as barbacoa, chilaquiles, milanesas, and many others.</p>

	<p> The Estadio Azteca, regarded as one of the iconic football stadiums in the world, hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals and was the main venue of the 1968 Summer Olympics.</p>
	<p> Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so.[292] The country has also hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986.[293]</p>
	<p> Mexico's most popular sport is association football. It is commonly believed that football was introduced in Mexico by Cornish miners at the end of the 19th century. By 1902 a five-team league had emerged with a strong British influence.[294][295] Mexico's top clubs are América with 12 championships, Guadalajara with 11, and Toluca with 10.[296] Antonio Carbajal was the first player to appear in five World Cups,[297] and Hugo Sánchez was named best CONCACAF player of the 20th century by IFFHS.[298]</p>
	<p> Game at the Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey. Baseball is most popular in the North (particularly Northwest) and Southeast of Mexico.</p>
	<p> The Mexican professional baseball league is named the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol. While usually not as strong as the United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless achieved several international baseball titles.[citation needed] Mexican teams have won the Caribbean Series nine times. Mexico has had several players signed by Major League teams, the most famous of them being Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.</p>
	<p> In 2013, Mexico's basketball team won the Americas Basketball Championship and qualified for the 2014 Basketball World Cup where it reached the playoffs. Because of these achievements the country earned the hosting rights for the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship.[299]</p>
	<p> Bullfighting is a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings. Plaza México in Mexico City, is the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. Professional wrestling (or Lucha libre in Spanish) is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as AAA, CMLL and others.</p>
	<p> Mexico is an international power in professional boxing (at the amateur level, several Olympic boxing medals have also been won by Mexico). Vicente Saldivar, Rubén Olivares, Salvador Sánchez, Julio César Chávez, Ricardo Lopez and Erik Morales are but a few Mexican fighters who have been ranked among the best of all time.[300]</p>
	<p> Notable Mexican athletes include golfer Lorena Ochoa, who was ranked first in the LPGA world rankings prior to her retirement,[301] Ana Guevara, former world champion of the 400 metres (1,300 ft) and Olympic subchampion in Athens 2004, Fernando Platas, four-time Olympic medal winning diver, and taekwondo fighter María Espinoza, most decorated Mexican female Olympian.</p>

	<p> Since the early 1990s, Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan.[302] Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities,[303][304] but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care.[116] Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico.</p>
	<p> State-funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security. Private health services are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the country.[305]</p>
	<p> Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the University of Guadalajara, have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine. Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.[303]</p>

	<p> In 2004, the literacy rate was at 97%[306] for youth under the age of 14 and 91% for people over 15,[307] placing Mexico at the 24th place in the world rank according to UNESCO.[308]</p>
	<p> The National Autonomous University of Mexico ranks 190th place in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by The Times Higher Education Supplement in 2009.[309] Private business schools also stand out in international rankings. IPADE and EGADE, the business schools of Universidad Panamericana and of Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education respectively, were ranked in the top 10 in a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal among recruiters outside the United States.[310]</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Monarchy , form of government in which an individual rules according to fixed and settled laws.
	<p> A monarchy is a state in which the sovereign power, and all of the rights that are essential to it, reside indivisibly in one man who is called king, monarch, or emperor.</p>
	<p> Let us follow M. de Montesquieu in setting forth the basis for this form of government, how it is maintained, and how it declines. [1]</p>
	<p> The nature of monarchy is that the monarch is the source of all political and civil power, and that he alone governs the state according to fundamental laws; for, a state that is governed according to the momentary caprices of an individual, without any fundamental laws, has a despotic government in which one man controls everything according his will alone; monarchy , however, commands according to laws that are placed in the charge of the political bodies of the state, whose task it is to announce the laws when they are made and to call attention to them when they have been forgotten.</p>
	<p> Monarchy , unlike the republican form of government, is not based upon morality. In a monarchy , the laws take the place of the virtues, and the laws do not concern themselves with love of country, the desire for true glory, self- abnegation, the sacrifice of one's dearest interests, or any of the heroic virtues of the ancients that we have only heard tell of. Morals are never so pure in a monarchy as they are under republican governments, and the virtues that are displayed in a monarchy are always less concerned with what one owes to others than with what one owes to oneself. The monarchic virtues do not so much bring us closer to our fellow citizens as they distinguish us from them; honor, that is to say, the prejudices of each person and each social class, is, in a monarchy , the substitute for political virtue. Honor enters into all the ways of thinking and feeling. It whimsically expands or contracts the duties of individuals, even those duties imposed by religion, policy or morality. Honor, however, can inspire the most beautiful actions; it can even, when incorporated into the laws, achieve the goals of government just as virtue does.</p>
	<p> Such is the strength of monarchic government that it employs all of its component parts just as it pleases. Because all wealth, honors and rewards flow from the prince, the desire to merit these things maintains his throne. In addition, because all public affairs are directed by one individual, order, diligence, secrecy, subordination, the greatest goals and the most efficient execution are certain to result. Even in crises, the safety of the prince is connected to the incorruptibility of all the different social orders; and subversives who have neither the will to overthrow the state nor the hope of doing so, cannot and do not wish to overthrow the prince.</p>
	<p> If the monarch is virtuous, if he distributes rewards and punishments with justice and discernment, then all will be eager to merit his favors, and his reign will be the golden age; but if the monarch is not such, then the same principle that would have lifted the souls of his subjects to participate in his graces, to rise above the crowd with fine deeds, will degenerate instead into baseness and slavery. Romans, you triumphed under the first two Caesars; under the rest, you became the vilest of mortals.</p>
	<p> A monarchy is in decay when the highest honors are the insignia of the highest level of slavery; when the respect of the people is taken away from their leaders, and when those leaders become the instruments of arbitrary power.</p>
	<p> It is in decay when singularly cowardly souls are proud of their slavish grandeur; when they believe that to owe everything to the prince means owing nothing to one’s country; and all the more when flattery, bearing a cosmetic jar in its hand, spares no effort to convince the one who holds the scepter that men are to their sovereigns what all of nature is to its Author.</p>
	<p> The foundation of a monarchy is rotten when the prince turns his justice into severity, when he places, as did the Roman emperors, the head of Medusa on his chest; when he affects the menacing and terrible appearance that Commodus caused to be graven on his statues.</p>
	<p> Monarchy is lost when the prince believes that he can make more of a demonstration of his power by changing the order of things than by following it; when he deprives the branches of government of their authority; when he takes away a function that is the natural responsibility one branch and assigns it arbitrarily to another; and when he is in love with his frivolous whims.</p>
	<p> A monarchy is lost when the monarch involves himself directly in everything, and summons the whole state to the capital, the capital to his court, and his court to his own person.</p>
	<p> A monarchy is lost when a prince misunderstands his authority, his position, and the love of his people, and does not feel that a monarch should consider himself to be safe, just as a despot should consider himself to be in danger.</p>
	<p> A monarchy is lost, when a prince, deceived by his ministers, comes to believe that the poorer his subjects are, the larger their families will be, and that the more they are weighed down with taxes, the better able they will be to pay them. These are two false precepts that I consider to be crimes against the crown: they have always ruined and always will ruin all monarchies. Republics are destroyed by luxury; monarchies, by poverty and decline in population.</p>
	<p> Finally, a monarchy is absolutely finished when it lapses into despotism, a form of government that quickly throws a nation into barbarity, and from there into an abyss of destruction into which the despot’s heavy yoke will also fall.</p>
	<p> But, if someone should say to the subjects of a monarchy whose foundation is crumbling, “A Prince has been born to you who will reestablish that foundation in all its glory. Nature has endowed this successor with all of the virtues and with personal qualities that will delight you. All that you need do is help them to develop.” Alas! I fear that your hopes will be disappointed. There are monsters who will cause this beautiful flower to wilt, who will smother it even as it is being born. Their poison breath will extinguish the faculties of this heir to the throne so that they can bend him to their will. They will fill his soul with errors, prejudices and superstitions. They will fill him with ignorance and with their pernicious maxims. They will infect him with the will to power that obsesses them.</p>
	<p> These are the principal causes of the decline and of the fall of the most flourishing monarchies. Heu! quam pereunt brevibus ingentia causis! [2]</p>
	<p> 1. Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755). The discussion in this article is taken from De l’esprit des lois (The Spirit of Laws) (1748).</p>
	<p> 2. “Alas! From such slight causes are great things destroyed.”</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy), to completely autocratic (absolute monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected.[1] Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.</p>
	<p> Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia "reign, but do not rule" although there is considerable variation in the degree of authority they wield. Although they reign under constitutions, the monarchs of Brunei, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations, either by constitutional mandate or by tradition.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology[edit]</h4>
	<p> The word "monarch" (Latin: monarcha) comes from the Greek language word μονάρχης, monárkhēs (from μόνος monos, "one, singular", and ἄρχω árkhō, "to rule" (compare ἄρχων arkhon, "leader, ruler, chief")) which referred to a single, at least nominally absolute ruler. In current usage the word monarchy usually refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are rare nowadays.</p>
	<p> Depending on the title held by the monarch, a monarchy may be known as a kingdom, principality, duchy, grand duchy, empire, tsardom, emirate, sultanate, khaganate, etc.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History[edit]</h4>
	<p> The form of societal hierarchy known as chiefdom or tribal kingship is prehistoric. The Greek term monarchia is classical, used by Herodotus (3.82). The monarch in classical antiquity is often identified as "king" (translating archon, basileus, rex, tyrannos etc.). From earliest historical times, with the Egyptian and Mesopotamian monarchs, as well as in reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion, the king holds sacral function directly connected to sacrifice, or is considered of divine ancestry.</p>
	<p> The role of the Roman emperor as the protector of Christianity was conflated with the sacral aspects held by the Germanic kings to create the notion of "Divine right of kings" in the Christian Middle Ages. The Chinese, Japanese and Nepalese monarchs continued to be considered living Gods into the modern period.</p>
	<p> Since antiquity, monarchy has contrasted with forms of democracy, where executive power is wielded by assemblies of free citizens. In antiquity, monarchies were abolished in favour of such assemblies in Rome (Roman Republic, 509 BC), and Athens (Athenian democracy, 500 BC).</p>
	<p> In Germanic antiquity, kingship was primarily a sacral function, and the king was either directly hereditary for some tribes, while for others he was elected from among eligible members of royal families by the thing.</p>
	<p> Such ancient "parliamentarism" declined during the European Middle Ages, but it survived in forms of regional assemblies, such as the Icelandic Commonwealth, the Swiss Landsgemeinde and later Tagsatzung, and the High Medieval communal movement linked to the rise of medieval town privileges.</p>
	<p> The modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the English monarchy by the Parliament of England in 1649, followed by the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1792. One of many opponents of that trend was Elizabeth Dawbarn, whose anonymous Dialogue between Clara Neville and Louisa Mills, on Loyalty (1794) features "silly Louisa, who admires liberty, Tom Paine and the USA, [who is] lectured by Clara on God's approval of monarchy" and on the influence women can exert on men.[2] Much of 19th century politics was characterised by the division between anti-monarchist Radicalism and monarchist Conservativism.</p>
	<p> Many countries abolished the monarchy in the 20th century and became republics, especially in the wake of either World War I or World War II. Advocacy of republics is called republicanism, while advocacy of monarchies is called monarchism. In the modern era, monarchies are more prevalent in small states than in large ones.[3]</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Characteristics and role[edit]</h4>
	<p> Monarchies are associated with political or sociocultural hereditary rule, in which monarchs rule for life (although some monarchs do not hold lifetime positions: for example, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia serves a five-year term) and pass the responsibilities and power of the position to their child or another member of their family when they die. Most monarchs, both historically and in the modern day, have been born and brought up within a royal family, the centre of the royal household and court. Growing up in a royal family (called a dynasty when it continues for several generations), future monarchs are often trained for the responsibilities of expected future rule.</p>
	<p> Different systems of succession have been used, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority (Salic law). While most monarchs have been male, many female monarchs also have reigned in history; the term queen regnant refers to a ruling monarch, while a queen consort refers to the wife of a reigning king. Rule may be hereditary in practice without being considered a monarchy, such as that of family dictatorships[4] or political families in many democracies.[5]</p>
	<p> The principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership (as seen in the classic phrase "The King is dead. Long live the King!").</p>
	<p> Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an elective monarchy, monarchs are elected, or appointed by some body (an electoral college) for life or a defined period, but otherwise serve as any other monarch. Three elective monarchies exist today: Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates are 20th-century creations, while one (the papacy) is ancient.</p>
	<p> A self-proclaimed monarchy is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. Napoleon I of France declared himself Emperor of the French and ruled the First French Empire after previously calling himself First Consul following his seizure of power in the coup of 18 Brumaire. Jean-Bédel Bokassa of the Central African Republic declared himself "Emperor" of the Central African Empire. Yuan Shikai crowned himself Emperor of the short-lived "Empire of China" a few years after the Republic of China was founded.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Powers of the monarch[edit]</h3>
	<p> Today, the extent of the monarch's powers varies:</p>
	<p>  • In an absolute monarchy, the monarch rules as an autocrat, with absolute power over the state and government — for example, the right to rule by decree, promulgate laws, and impose punishments. Absolute monarchies are not necessarily authoritarian; the enlightened absolutists of the Age of Enlightenment were monarchs who allowed various freedoms.</p>
	<p>  • In a constitutional monarchy, the monarch is subject to a constitution. The monarch serves as a ceremonial figurehead symbol of national unity and state continuity. The monarch is nominally sovereign but the electorate, through their legislature, exercise (usually limited) political sovereignty. Constitutional monarchs have limited political power, except in Japan and Sweden, where the constitutions grant no power to their monarchs.[citation needed] Typical monarchical powers include granting pardons, granting honours, and reserve powers, e.g. to dismiss the prime minister, refuse to dissolve parliament, or veto legislation ("withhold Royal Assent"). They often also have privileges of inviolability, sovereign immunity, and an official residence. A monarch's powers and influence may depend on tradition, precedent, popular opinion, and law.</p>
	<p>  • In other cases the monarch's power is limited, not due to constitutional restraints, but to effective military rule. In the late Roman Empire, the Praetorian Guard several times deposed Roman Emperors and installed new emperors. The Hellenistic kings of Macedon and of Epirus were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the ecclesia of democracies, the council of all free citizens; military service was often linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house. Military domination of the monarch has occurred in modern Thailand and in medieval Japan (where a hereditary military chief, the shogun, was the de facto ruler, although the Japanese emperor nominally ruled). In Fascist Italy the Savoy monarchy under King Victor Emmanuel III coexisted with the Fascist single-party rule of Benito Mussolini; Romania under the Iron Guard and Greece during the first months of the Colonels' regime were much the same way. Spain under Francisco Franco was officially a monarchy, although there was no monarch on the throne. Upon his death, Franco was succeeded as head of state by the Bourbon heir, Juan Carlos I, who proceeded to make Spain a democracy with himself as a figurehead constitutional monarch.[citation needed]</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Person of monarch[edit]</h3>
	<p> Most states only have a single person acting as monarch at any given time, although two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, a situation known as diarchy. Historically this was the case in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta or 17th-century Russia, and there are examples of joint sovereignty of spouses or relatives (such as William and Mary in the Kingdoms of England and Scotland). Other examples of joint sovereignty include Tsars Peter I and Ivan V of Russia, and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Joanna of Castile of the Crown of Castile.</p>
	<p> Andorra currently is the world's sole constitutional diarchy or co-principality. Located in the Pyrenees between Spain and France, it has two co-princes: the Bishop of Urgell (a prince-bishop) in Spain and the President of France (inherited ex officio from the French kings, who themselves inherited the title from the counts of Foix). It is the only situation in which an independent country's (co-)monarch is democratically elected by the citizens of another country.</p>
	<p> In a personal union, separate independent states share the same person as monarch, but each realm retains its separate laws and government. The sixteen separate Commonwealth realms are sometimes described as being in a personal union with Queen Elizabeth II as monarch, however, they can also be described as being in a shared monarchy.</p>
	<p> A regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, absent, or debilitated.</p>
	<p> A pretender is a claimant to an abolished throne or to a throne already occupied by somebody else.</p>
	<p> Abdication is the act of formally giving up one's monarchical power and status.</p>
	<p> Monarchs may mark the ceremonial beginning of their reigns with a coronation or enthronement.</p>
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Role of monarch[edit]</h3>
	<p> Monarchy, especially absolute monarchy, sometimes is linked to religious aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a deity (Divine Right of Kings, Mandate of Heaven), a special connection to a deity (sacred king) or even purported to be divine kings, or incarnations of deities themselves (imperial cult). Many European monarchs have been styled Fidei defensor (Defender of the Faith); some hold official positions relating to the state religion or established church.</p>
	<p> In the Western political tradition, a morally-based, balanced monarchy is stressed as the ideal form of government, and little reverence is paid to modern-day ideals of egalitarian democracy: e.g. Saint Thomas Aquinas unapologetically declares: "Tyranny is wont to occur not less but more frequently on the basis of polyarchy [rule by many, i.e. oligarchy or democracy] than on the basis of monarchy." (On Kingship). However, Thomas Aquinas also stated that the ideal monarchical system would also have at lower levels of government both an aristocracy and elements of democracy in order to create a balance of power. The monarch would also be subject to both natural and divine law, as well, and also be subject to the Church in matters of religion.</p>
	<p> In Dante Alighieri's De Monarchia, a spiritualised, imperial Catholic monarchy is strongly promoted according to a Ghibelline world-view in which the "royal religion of Melchizedek" is emphasised against the sacerdotal claims of the rival papal ideology.</p>
	<p> In Saudi Arabia, the king is a head of state who is both the absolute monarch of the country and the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques of Islam (خادم الحرمين الشريفين). ––</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Titles of monarchs</h3>
	<p> Monarchs can have various titles. Common European titles of monarchs are emperor or empress (from Latin: imperator or imperatrix), king or queen, grand duke or grand duchess, prince or princess, duke or duchess (in that hierarchical order of nobility).[6] Some early modern European titles (especially in German states) included elector (German: Kurfürst, literally "prince-elector"), margrave (German: Markgraf, equivalent to the French title marquis), and burgrave (German: Burggraf, literally "count of the castle"). Lesser titles include count, princely count, or imam (Use in Oman). Slavic titles include knyaz and tsar (ц︢рь) or tsaritsa (царица), a word derived from the Roman imperial title Caesar.</p>
	<p> In non-Europe, monarchs can have various titles too. Muslim worlds titles of monarchs include caliph (successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a leader of the entire Muslim community), padishah (emperor), sultan or sultana, shâhanshâh (emperor), shah, malik (king) or malikah (queen), emir (commander, prince) or emira (princess), sheikh or sheikha. East Asian titles of monarchs include huángdì (emperor or empress regnant), tiānzǐ (son of heaven), tennō (emperor) or josei tennō (empress regnant), wang (king) or yeowang (queen regnant), hwangje (emperor) or yeohwang (empress regnant). South Asian and South East Asian titles included mahārāja (emperor) or maharani (empress), raja (king) and rana (king) or rani (queen) and ratu (South East Asian queen). Historically, Mongolic or Turkic monarchs have used the title khan and khagan (emperor) or khatun and khanum and Ancient Egypt monarchs have used the title pharaoh for men and women. In Ethiopian Empire, monarchs used title nəgusä nägäst (king of kings) or nəgəstä nägäst (queen of kings).</p>
	<p> Many monarchs are addressed with particular styles or manners of address, such as "Majesty", "Royal Highness", "By the Grace of God", Amīr al-Mu'minīn ("Leader of the Faithful"), Hünkar-i Khanedan-i Âl-i Osman, "Sovereign of the Sublime House of Osman"), Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda ("Majesty"), Jeonha ("Majesty"), Tennō Heika (literally "His Majesty the heavenly sovereign"), Bìxià ("Bottom of the Steps").</p>
	<p> Sometimes titles are used to express claims to territories that are not held in fact (for example, English claims to the French throne), or titles not recognised (antipopes). Also, after a monarchy is deposed, often former monarchs and their descendants are given titles (the King of Portugal was given the hereditary title Duke of Braganza).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Dependent monarchies[edit]</h3>
	<p> In some cases monarchs are dependent on other powers (see vassals, suzerainty, puppet state, hegemony). In the British colonial era indirect rule under a paramount power existed, such as the princely states under the British Raj.</p>
	<p> In Botswana, South Africa, Ghana and Uganda, the ancient kingdoms and chiefdoms that were met by the colonialists when they first arrived on the continent are now constitutionally protected as regional and/or sectional entities. Furthermore, in Nigeria, though the dozens of sub-regional polities that exist there are not provided for in the current constitution, they are nevertheless legally recognised aspects of the structure of governance that operates in the nation. In addition to these five countries, peculiar monarchies of varied sizes and complexities exist in various other parts of Africa.[specify]</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Succession[edit]</h4>
	<p> The rules for selection of monarchs varies from country to country. In constitutional monarchies the rule of succession is generally embodied in a law passed by a representative body, such as a parliament.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Hereditary monarchies[edit]</h3>
	<p> In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary order of succession, usually within one royal family tracing its origin through a historical dynasty or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession.</p>
	<p> Primogeniture, in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically "agnatic primogeniture" or "patrilineal primogeniture" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or head of family, with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and male-line males inheriting before females of the male line.[7] This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from dynastic succession is commonly referred to as application of the Salic law (see Terra salica).</p>
	<p> Before primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in coregency – a senior king and a junior king. Examples include Henry the Young King of England and the early Direct Capetians in France.</p>
	<p> Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted.</p>
	<p> In 1980, Sweden became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.[8] Other kingdoms (such as the Netherlands in 1983, Norway in 1990, Belgium in 1991, Denmark and Luxembourg[9]) have since followed suit. The United Kingdom adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.</p>
	<p> Sometimes religion is affected; for example the British monarch, as head of the Church of England, is required to be in communion with the Church, although all other former rules forbidding marriage to non-Protestants were abolished when equal primogeniture was adopted in 2013.</p>
	<p> In the case of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the collateral line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture. This has often led, especially in Europe in the Middle Ages, to conflict between the principle of primogeniture and the principle of proximity of blood.</p>
	<p> Other hereditary systems of succession included tanistry, which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and Agnatic seniority. In some monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Elective monarchies[edit]</h3>
	<p> In an elective monarchy, monarchs are elected, or appointed by some body (an electoral college) for life or a defined period, but otherwise serve as any other monarch. There is no popular vote involved in elective monarchies, as the elective body usually consists of a small number of eligible people. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the Holy Roman Emperors (chosen by prince-electors, but often coming from the same dynasty), and the free election of kings of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For example, Pepin the Short (father of Charlemagne) was elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish leading men; Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland was an elected king, as was Frederick I of Denmark. Germanic peoples had elective monarchies.</p>
	<p> Four forms of elective monarchies exist today. The pope of the Roman Catholic Church (who rules as Sovereign of the Vatican City State) is elected to a life term by the College of Cardinals. In Malaysia, the federal king, called the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or Paramount Ruler is elected for a five-year term from among and by the hereditary rulers (mostly sultans) of nine of the federation's constitutive states, all on the Malay peninsula. The United Arab Emirates also has a procedure for electing its monarch. Furthermore, Andorra has a unique constitutional arrangement as one of its heads of state is the President of the French Republic in the form of a Co-Prince. This is the only instance in the world where the monarch of a state is elected by the citizens of a different country.</p>
	<p> Appointment by the current monarch is another system, used in Jordan. It also was used in Imperial Russia; however, it was changed to semi-Salic soon, because the instability of the appointment system resulted in an age of palace revolutions. In this system, the monarch chooses the successor, who is always his relative.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Current monarchies</h4>
	<p> Currently there are 43 nations in the world with a monarch as head of state. They fall roughly into the following categories:</p>
	<p> • Commonwealth realms. Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch of sixteen Commonwealth realms (Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). They have evolved out of the British Empire into fully independent states within the Commonwealth of Nations that retain the Queen as head of state, unlike other Commonwealth countries that are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. The Queen is head of the established Church of England in the United Kingdom, while the other 15 realms do not have an established church.</p>
	<p> • Other European constitutional monarchies. The Principality of Andorra, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Kingdom of Sweden are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. There is generally a Christian religion established as the official church in each of these countries. This is the Lutheran form of Protestantism in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while Belgium and Andorra are Roman Catholic countries. Spain and the Netherlands have no official State religion. Luxembourg, which is very predominantly Roman Catholic, has five so-called officially recognised cults of national importance (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Greek Orthodoxy, Judaism and Islam), a status which gives to those religions some privileges like the payment of a state salary to their priests. Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is, by definition, a diarchy, with the Co-Princeship being shared by the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell. This situation, based on historic precedence, has created a peculiar situation among monarchies, as a) both Co-Princes are not of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgel, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope.</p>
	<p> • European constitutional/absolute monarchies. Liechtenstein and Monaco are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince theoretically retains many powers of an absolute monarch. In reality, he is a figurehead who is expected not to use that power. For example, the 2003 Constitution referendum which gives the Prince of Liechtenstein the power to veto any law that the Landtag (parliament) proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However, what makes him not an absolute monarch is that the people can call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. When Crown Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011 (which didn't actually happen), voters were surprised because the Prince hasn't vetoed any law for over 3 decades. The Prince of Monaco has simpler powers but cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the minister of state, government council and judges. Both Albert II and Hans-Adam II are theoretically very powerful, but in practice even they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.</p>
	<p> • Islamic monarchies. These Islamic monarchs of the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the State of Kuwait, Malaysia, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. The Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace, the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remain absolute monarchies; the Kingdom of Bahrain, the State of Kuwait and United Arab Emirates are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Malaysia and the Kingdom of Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than European equivalents.</p>
	<p> • East Asian constitutional monarchies. The Kingdom of Bhutan, the Kingdom of Cambodia, Japan, the Kingdom of Thailand have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. The Kingdom of Bhutan, Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand are countries that were never colonised by European powers, but Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand have changed from traditional absolute monarchies into constitutional ones during the twentieth century, while the Kingdom of Bhutan changed in 2008. The Kingdom of Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the French Colonial Empire, which was deposed after the Khmer Rouge came into power and the subsequent invasion by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993.</p>
	<p> • Other monarchies. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the Kingdom of Tonga in Polynesia; the Kingdom of Swaziland and the Kingdom of Lesotho in Africa; the Vatican City State; the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Europe. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Swaziland and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Swaziland is also unique among these monarchies, often being considered a diarchy. The King, or Ngwenyama, rules alongside his mother, the Ndlovukati, as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which more or less has become symbolic in recent years.</p>
	<p> The Pope is the absolute monarch of the Vatican City State (different entity from the Holy See) by virtue of his position as head of the Roman Catholic Church and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler and does not have to be a citizen of the territory prior to his election by the cardinals.</p>
	<p> The ruling Kim family in North Korea (Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy[10][11][12] or "hereditary dictatorship".[13] In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the new edited Ten Fundamental Principles of the Korean Workers' Party states that the party and revolution must be carried "eternally" by the "Baekdu(Kim's) bloodline".[14]</p>`

	eArt: `<p>Money is a sign that represents the value, the measure of all useful goods, and that is given as the price of all things. We use a metal so that the sign, the measure, the price will be stable, so that it will be little consumed by use, and so that it may be greatly divided without being destroyed.</p>
	<p> We seek earnestly to know: 1) whence money derives its value, 2) whether this value is variable and imaginary, 3) whether the sovereign should make alterations to the money , and set the ratio of the metals. In this essay we propose to resolve all these interesting questions by drawing on the wisdom of the author of the Considérations sur les finances.<p> 
	<p> To avoid disputes about words, let us distinguish between the denomination or numerical value of money , which is arbitrary; its intrinsic value, which depends on its weight and degree of purity; and its accidental value, which depends on the commercial circumstances of the transaction by which one trades goods for money. Thus money can be defined as a piece of metal to which the prince gives a form, a name and a stamp, in order to certify its weight and standard in any exchange that might occur for all goods that men wish to place in trade.<p> 
	<p> Mr. Boizard gives us a different idea of money , for he defines it as a piece of matter to which the public authority has given a weight and a fixed value, in order to serve as the price of all things in trade.<p> 
	<p> Money does not receive its value from the public authority, as Mr. Boizard claims. Its stamp indicates its weight and standard. It demonstrates that the coin is composed of a certain amount of metal of a certain purity, but it does not give value. Rather the matter gives it its value.<p> 
	<p> The prince may decide to call a coin of twenty sous [i.e., one livre] an écu, and require that it be accepted as four livres. This is a way to tax his subjects, who are obliged to accept it at this rate. Nevertheless he does not augment the value of the twenty-sou coin. It does indeed circulate as four livres, but then the livre is worth only what five sous [i.e., one-fourth livre] was worth before the revaluation.<p> 
	<p> If the prince gave value to money , he could give the value of an écu to pewter, to lead or to other metals minted into one-ounce coins, and make them serve in trade as silver money currently does. But when the prince had given the form and name of an écu to an ounce of pewter, his subject would not give the value of an écu in merchandise for a pewter écu, because the matter from which it is made is not worth it. <p> 
	<p> Money is not a fixed value, as Mr. Boizard also says, for even if the prince makes no alteration, and if the coins maintain the same weight and standard and are subject to the same price, still the value of money is variable.<p> 
	<p> To prove this I will show whence goods derive their value, how this value is perceived, and how it changes.<p> 
	<p> Goods derive their value from the uses to which they are employed. If they had no use they would have no value.<p> 
	<p> The value of goods is higher or lower depending on their supply in proportion to demand. Water is not sold but given away because the supply is greater than the demand. Wine is sold because the demand for wine is greater than the supply.<p> 
	<p> The value of goods changes when the supply or the demand changes. If the supply of wine is great, or if the demand for wine diminishes, then the price falls. If wine is scarce, or if the demand increases, then the price rises.<p> 
	<p> The good or poor quality of goods, and the greater or lesser use to which they are employed, are assumed. When I say that their value is higher or lower depending on their supply in proportion to demand, the better or worse quality does not increase or reduce the price except to the extent that the difference in quality increases or reduces the demand.<p> 
	<p> Example: If this year’s wine is not as good as it was last year, then the demand for wine will not be as great and the price will fall. But if wine is also less abundant, and if the decline in supply matches the decline in demand, then it will continue to be sold at the same price even though it is not as good. The decline in supply will increase the price just as the difference in quality will reduce it, and the supply thus has the same proportion to demand as it did the previous year.<p> 
	<p> Water is more useful and necessary than wine. Thus neither the quality of goods nor the uses to which they are employed alter their price, except to the extent that the proportion of quality  to demand is altered. It follows that their value is greater or less depending on how the supply is proportioned to the demand. Their value changes when the supply or the demand changes. In the same way gold and silver, like other goods, derive their value from the uses to which they are employed.<p> 
	<p> As money derives its value from the matters from which it is made, and as the value of these matters is variable, money is of variable value even if it maintains the same weight and standard and is subject to the same price. If the supply of the matters suffers any change of value, then the écu will have the same weight and standard and will circulate as the same number of livres or sous, but the supply of the sliver matter having increased, or the demand having decreased, the écu will not have the same value.<p> 
	<p> If a unit of wheat is sold for twice as much money as it was fifty years ago, one imagines that wheat has become more expensive. Yet this difference in price may be the result of changes to the supply of or demand for money. In that case it is the money that has become cheaper.<p> 
	<p> As long as coins maintain the same weight and standard, and are subject to the same prices, we take little note of changes to the value of money , or of the matter of gold and silver, but that does not mean that their value does not change. Neither the écu nor an ounce of silver is worth what it was a century ago. The value of all things changes, and the value of money has changed more than that of other goods. The increase in its supply since the discovery of the Indies has so diminished its value that ten ounces in matter or in coin is worth less than what one ounce was once worth.<p> 
	<p> To convince oneself that what I am arguing is true, one may examine the prices of land, houses, wheat, wine and other goods before the discovery of the Indies. At that time a thousand ounces of silver, whether unminted or minted, purchased more of these goods than ten thousand would purchase today. The goods are not more expensive or have changed little. Since their supply is in nearly the same proportion to demand as it was, silver must be cheaper.<p> 
	<p> Those who use silver plate think that they lose only the interest they forego on the quantity employed, and the cost of the tax and the manufacture, but they also lose the amount that the matter declines in value, and its value declines to the extent that its supply increases, so long as the demand does not increase accordingly. A family that has used ten thousand ounces of silver plate for two hundred years has lost on the value of its silver more than nine thousand ounces, besides the manufacture, the tax and the interest, because ten thousand ounces are worth less than what one thousand were worth at that time.<p> 
	<p> The Indies Companies of England and Holland have exported a large amount of unminted and minted silver to the East Indies, and Europe also consumes it, which to some extent has supported its value. But despite this exportation and consumption, the great quantity imported has reduced its value by ninety percent.<p> 
	<p> The supply of gold has increased more than its demand, and gold has fallen in value. But because its supply has not risen in the same proportion as silver, its value has not fallen as much. Two hundred years ago the ounce of gold in France was worth sixteen livres, five sous, four deniers, and the ounce of silver was worth one livre, twelve sous. An ounce of unminted or minted gold was thus worth ten ounces of silver. Today it is worth more than fifteen. Thus these metals are no longer worth what they were with respect to other goods, nor with respect to each other. Gold, though fallen in value, is worth half again as much in silver as it once was.<p> 
	<p> On the basis of what I have just said, it is clear that the prince does not give value to money , as Mr. Boizard claims, for its value consists in the matter of which it is made. It is therefore clear that its value is not fixed, because experience shows that it has diminished since the discovery of the Indies by more than ninety percent.<p> 
	<p> By these diminutions I am not referring to the weakenings of the coinage that princes have carried out. I am speaking only of the diminution of the [value of the] matter caused by the increase in their supply.<p> 
	<p> When we come to examine these weakenings, we will discover that less than one part remains in fifty. That is to say, there was once as much silver in twenty sous [i.e., one livre] as there is now in fifty livres. This is proven by the ordinances concerning the manufacture of French sous in the year 755. At that time there was the same quantity of pure silver in one sou as there is now in the half-écu, which is worth fifty sous. But without going back so far, over the last two hundred years the silver coins have been weakened in France by about two-thirds of their value.<p> 
	<p> Those whose income is payable in money have also suffered by the decline in interest. Before the discovery of the Indies, annuities were constituted at one-tenth [i.e., ten percent per annum]. Today they are at one-twentieth [i.e., five percent per annum]. A donation made two hundred years ago, intended for the upkeep of fifty people, today can barely support one. Suppose that the donation was mortgaged for a sum of ten thousand livres. Because money was scarce, annuities were constituted at one-tenth. At that time one thousand livres in interest could support fifty people. Due to its scarcity money was of greater value, but as it became more abundant due to the quantity of matter imported into Europe, interest fell to five percent. The interest on the mortgage has thus fallen from a thousand to five hundred livres. As a result of the weakenings that princes have carried out, there remains only the standard of silver in the money [but two-thirds less weight], which reduces the value of five hundred livres to 166 livres 13 s. 4 d., and since the matter itself fell in value by ninety percent, five hundred livres [in] weak currency are worth no more than what sixteen livres were worth two hundred years ago, and will purchase no more necessities than sixteen livres would have purchased. Based on these assumptions, a sum intended for the upkeep of fifty people can no longer support one person.<p> 
	<p> The quantity of matter imported into Europe since the discovery of the Indies has not only disturbed the wealth and income of individuals, but has also disturbed states, which are no longer in the same proportion of force. Those that have profited most from trade with Spain abound in specie, while the others can barely sustain their previous condition.<p> 
	<p> It is not surprising that Mr. Boizard, a Frenchman, erred in his ideas on money , but Mr. Locke, an Englishman and a profound thinker who made himself famous by his beautiful works on this subject, should not have fallen into a misconception similar to that [of] Mr. Boizard. He thinks that men by common consent have given an imaginary value to money.<p> 
	<p> I cannot conceive how men of different nations, or even those of the same province, could agree to put an imaginary value upon anything, especially upon money , by which the value of all other goods is measured, and that is given as the price of all things, or that any one country would want to receive a value in exchange or payment for more than it was worth, or how that imaginary value could have been kept up.<p> 
	<p> Suppose that in England money were received at an imaginary value, and that other nations had consented to receive it at that value, then the écu passing in England for sixty pence, should pass in Holland for sixty stivers, the penny and the stiver being nothing but numbers that one uses to count. But we see just the opposite: money is valued and received according to the quantity and quality of matters of which it is composed.<p> 
	<p> Before silver was used as money , its value depended on the uses to which it was employed. It was received as money on the basis of what it was as matter. If silver had had no value before it was used as money , it would never have been so used. Who would have wanted to receive a matter of no value as the price of his goods? A pound of lead as money would be worth something, since lead has several uses when it is reduced to matter, but a pound of silver would be worthless if, reduced to matter, silver had no use as metal. So before it was employed as money , silver had a value that depended on the uses to which it was employed, and was received as money on the basis of its value as matter.<p> 
	<p> Being used to make money it increases its value, but this additional value does not derive from the manufacture or minting, for unminted silver is worth as much as minted silver, and this value is no more imaginary than the value that it possessed before it was used to make money.<p> 
	<p> Its first value, as metal, derived from the fact that silver had qualities that rendered it suitable for several uses to which it was employed. The additional value derived from the fact that this metal had qualities that rendered it appropriate to make money. These values are greater or less to the extent that the demand for this silver is proportioned to its supply.<p> 
	<p> If either of these values is imaginary, than all value is imaginary, for goods have no value except from the uses to which they are employed, and according to their supply in proportion to demand.<p> 
	<p> Let us see how and why silver has been used to make money.<p> 
	<p> Before the use of money was known, goods were exchanged. This exchange was often very cumbersome. At that time there was no measure with which to determine the value that goods had proportionally to each other. For example, A wished to barter fifty bushels of wheat for wine. One could not easily determine the quantity of wine that A should receive for his fifty bushels of wheat. For though the proportion of wine to wheat might be known for the previous year, if the wheat and wine were no longer of the same quality, or if as the result of a good or bad harvest they were more or less abundant, then the supply of wheat and wine being no longer in the same proportion to demand, their proportional value had changed, and fifty bushels of wheat might be worth twice the quantity of wine that it was worth the year before.<p> 
	<p> Since silver is capable of a certain standard, or in other words to be reduced to a certain degree of purity, being then little subject to changes in supply or demand, and as a result less variable in value, it was used as the middle term with which to determine the proportional value of goods. If fifty bushels of wheat were worth two hundred ounces of silver of a certain standard, and if two hundred ounces of silver of the same purity were worth thirty barrels of wine of the quality that A required in exchange, then thirty barrels of wine would be the equivalent of fifty bushels of wheat.<p> 
	<p> The proportional value of goods delivered to different places was even more difficult to determine. For example, a hundred pieces of Dutch canvas were delivered at Amsterdam to the order of a London merchant. If the Amsterdam merchant wrote that one should deliver at London, to his order, the value of these hundred pieces of canvas in English woolens, then the value of these hundred pieces of canvas could be determined neither by the supply of English woolens nor by their value at Amsterdam, because these woolens were more valuable at Amsterdam than at London, where they were to be delivered. Reciprocally, the value of the English woolens could be determined neither by the supply of Dutch canvases nor by the value of these woolens [ sic , for canvases] at London, because the canvases were more valuable at London than at Amsterdam, where they were to be delivered.<p> 
	<p> Silver being highly portable, and thus of nearly the same value in different places, was used as the measure with which to determine the proportion of goods delivered to different places. If at Amsterdam the hundred pieces of canvas were worth a thousand ounces of pure silver, and if at London a thousand ounces of pure silver were worth twenty pieces of woolen of the quality that the Dutch merchant required in exchange, then twenty of these pieces of woolen delivered at London were the equivalent of these hundred pieces of canvas delivered at Amsterdam.<p> 
	<p> Contracts, promises, etc. , being payable in goods, gave rise to disputes because goods of the same sort differ greatly in value. Example: A lent fifty bushels of wheat to B, and B promised to return them a year later. A claimed that the wheat that B returned was not of the same quality as that which he had lent, and since wheat cannot be standardized there was no way to judge the loss suffered by A in receiving wheat of an inferior quality. But silver, which can be standardized, was used as the value for which one contracted. Thus the person who made a loan received a contract payable in so many ounces of silver at such a standard, thereby avoiding all dispute.<p> 
	<p> It was difficult to find the goods that were required in exchange. Example: A had more wheat than he could consume and sought to barter it for wine, but since the region did not produce wine, in order to barter the wheat he was obliged to transport it to a place that had wine.<p> 
	<p> Silver, being more portable, was used as the middle term by which goods could be more easily exchanged. Thus A bartered his wheat for silver and carried the silver to the place where he bought the wine he needed.<p> 
	<p> Silver, along with its other qualities, being divisible without the loss of its value, as well as being portable, was better suited to these uses, and those who possessed goods that they did not immediately need converted them into silver. It was less cumbersome to store than other goods, its value was less subject to variation, and since it was more durable and divisible without loss of value, one could use all or part of it as the need arose. Thus unminted silver, having the necessary qualities, was employed to serve those uses that money serves today. Since it was capable of being stamped, princes established offices that purified it to a given standard and manufactured it. In this way the standard and the weight were known, and the inconvenience of weighing and refining it was spared.<p> 
	<p> But the manufacture does not give value to money , and its value is not imaginary. Money receives its value from the matters of which it is composed, and its value is greater or less depending on the proportion of supply to demand. Its value is therefore real, like the value of wheat, wine and other goods. Admittedly, if men found some other metal more suitable than silver to make money , and to serve the other uses to which unminted silver is employed, such as making plate, and if this metal were cheap, then silver would lose much of its value and would no longer be worth the expense of extracting it from mines. In the same way if men found some beverage that was more agreeable, healthier and cheaper than wine, then grapevines would cease to be valued, and would not be worth the expense of cultivation. The land would then be used to cultivate that which supplanted the consumption of wine.<p> 
	<p> It is not difficult to answer the third question, whether the sovereign should alter the money by weakening it, raising it or fixing the proportion between gold and silver. Experience shows that the first operation is harmful, the second and third are useless. All weakening of the kingdom’s money , far from attracting the coins and bullion of foreign countries, causes the transportation of the country’s coins, however weakened, as well as its bullion to foreign countries. By weakening I mean the minting fees, the taxes that princes levy on money [i.e., seigniorage duties], the raising of the coins and the reduction of their weight or standard.<p> 
	<p> The raising of money does not increase its price. We have long been misled by this error, that the same quantity of specie, when raised, had the same effect it would have if its quantity were increased. If, by making the écu of three livres pass for four livres, we could actually increase the value of the écu, and if this raised écu produced the same effect that four livres produced when the écu was at three livres, then there would be nothing to say. But this idea is as if a man who had three hundred yards of cloth to cover the walls of his apartment imagined that by simply measuring these three hundred yards with a three-quarter yardstick he would have four hundred yards of cloth, yet his apartment would not be covered any more completely. Raising the coins causes them to be worth more livres, but only by making the livres less valuable.<p> 
	<p> I assume that the ministers are aware that raising the coins does not make them more valuable, and that they alter the money only to save or raise funds for the prince, but they probably do not understand all the harmful consequences of these alterations.<p> 
	<p> The ancients considered money sacred. It was minted in the temples. The Romans minted money at state expense. The same weight of matter and of coin of the same standard had the same value.<p> 
	<p> The public authority, by minting money , is supposed to guarantee that the coins will be of a constant weight and standard, and receivable for the same number of livres, sous and deniers. Justice and honor oblige the prince, both toward his subjects and toward foreigners who trade with them, not to alter the money. It is the quantity and the quality of the matter that give value to the money , and not the price set by the prince. The matters that are suited to be used as money need to be minted, but the price of coins made of different matters should not be regulated by the prince.<p> 
	<p> Nor should he fix the ratio between gold and silver, because it varies constantly, and in the meantime this alteration causes unprofitable shipments, or harms certain trades. It suffices that the mark of silver should be fixed, and the market, depending on its needs, will determine the price of the mark of gold. In England the price of the gold in a guinea is twenty shillings sterling, yet it passes in trade for twenty-one shillings sterling. Admittedly this is only possible where coin is minted at public expense, and this is the true means to attract gold and silver. But a general rule for states that would fix the [bimetallic] ratio is to avoid both the lowest and the highest.<p> 
	<p> Some policy makers have claimed that, as a lower [bimetallic] ratio pays less for gold, and consequently attracts silver by preference, it is better suited for countries that trade with the East Indies. But one should also note that these countries have less advantage in their trade with nations who pay in gold. Today all [European] nations trade with the East Indies, and the re-exportation of these products is very limited. Thus this trade will become more and more unprofitable. In order to recoup its costs, it is essential to favor useful trade more and more.<p> 
	<p> What constitutes the real value of a coin of money is the number of grains of pure gold or pure silver that it contains. A gold coin at 24 karats [ sic , for 23 karats] weighing one ounce contains [five] hundred fifty-two grains of pure gold and twenty-four grains of alloy. A gold coin of 22 karats weighing one ounce, one dram and two grains will have the same intrinsic value as the first coin, the only difference being the twenty-six grains of alloy that it contains more than the first coin, which count for nothing. Not that a goldsmith who needs 23-karat gold for his work will not pay more in the market for the 23-karat gold coin than for the other, due to the cost that it would require to refine the 22-karat coin, as well as the greater expense of minting the 23-karat coin as a result of the same cost. Mines do not ordinarily produce gold finer than 22 karats, besides which the use of very fine gold is rare in trade. We should also note that if one needed 24-karat gold, a 24-karat gold coin would cost as much because of its refinement as the 22-karat gold coin [would cost to refine].<p>

For the passage here cited, see the article “Monoye” in the glossary (pages unnumbered) that Boizard includes with the front matter to the 3 rd edition, 2 vols (Paris: Le Febvre, 1711), vol. 1, and the 4 th edition, 2 vols (Paris: Coustelier, 1714), vol. 1.<p> 
	<p> 3. Like most monetary economists of the eighteenth century, Jaucourt fails to anticipate the rise of modern fiat currencies, which (so long as they are not over-issued) can exhibit stable purchasing power despite their lack of intrinsic value.<p> 
	<p> 4. To be precise, according to Jaucourt’s figures the bimetallic ratio in sixteenth-century France was 244/24, or roughly 10.17. At the time he was writing the official bimetallic ratio in Britain was 15.19, but in France it was only 14.58, as can be calculated from tables showing the silver and gold content of European coins in the article “Monnoies” in Encyclopédie méthodique: Commerce, 3 vols (Paris: Pankoucke, 1783-1784) vol. 17, pp. 270-271.<p> 
	<p> 5. That is, the market (and legal) rate of interest having fallen to one-half its former level, the silver content of the coinage having been reduced to one-third its former weight, and the purchasing power of silver having fallen to one-tenth its former value, the purchasing power of the annual coupon earned from the annuity was now only one-sixtieth its former value, thus reducing a coupon of 1,000 livres to the equivalent value of 16 ⅔ livres. Like Locke, Jaucourt here asserts what John Maynard Keynes has called “twin quantity theories,” arguing that the money supply is inversely related to the interest rate as well as to the purchasing power of money, each of which he understands as a “price” of money. Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (NY: Harcourt Brace, 1936), p. 343. This quantity theory of interest was characteristic of mercantilist writings, but came to be rejected by many of the liberal economists of the eighteenth century, including David Hume, Adam Smith and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot.<p> 
	<p> 6. Jaucourt’s critique of Locke depends in part on a misquotation, since Locke actually states that “Mankind [has] consented to put an imaginary Value upon Gold and Silver,” not upon money, the value of which derives (as for Jaucourt) from its intrinsic gold and silver content. Locke, Some Considerations, 2nd edn (London: Churchil, 1696), p. 31. (The same words do not appear in the comparable passage of Locke’s first edition of Some Considerations, p. 30.)

This and the following five paragraphs are based heavily on a passage in John Law, Money and Trade Considered, with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money (Edinburgh: Anderson, 1705), pp. 9-10. Jaucourt nowhere credits this source, perhaps because Law had such a poor reputation in France following the collapse of his financial “System” in the Mississippi Bubble of 1720.<p> 
	<p> 8. In fact unminted silver was not worth as much as minted silver. Jaucourt here ignores the seigniorage duties that European states imposed on the minting of coin.<p> 
	<p> 9. The mine (here translated “bushel”) was equivalent to about 79 liters, or more than two modern bushels. The muid (here translated “barrel”) varied in size from province to province. Jaucourt was probably thinking of the Paris muid, equivalent to about 268 liters. According to his figures, two liters of wine were thus worth about one liter of wheat.

	<p> 11. This confusingly worded paragraph alludes to the fact that Britain had at that time the highest bimetallic ratio in Europe, which created an incentive to transport the gold coins of other European countries to Britain and sell them to the mint. Of course it also created an incentive to export silver coins from Britain.<p>

	wArt:`Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money.
	<p> Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private".</p>
	<p> The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located. The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess Uni (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).</p>
	<p> In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie, stemming from Latin in specie, meaning 'in kind'.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<p> The use of barter-like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter. Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt. When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.</p>
	<p> Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of commodity money. The Mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight, and relied on the mass of something like 160 grains of barley. The first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used shell money – often, the shells of the cowry (Cypraea moneta L. or C. annulus L.). According to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins. It is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped coins were minted around 650–600 BC.</p>
	<p> Song Dynasty Jiaozi, the world's earliest paper money</p>
	<p> The system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of representative money. This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the commodity money deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the Song Dynasty. These banknotes, known as "jiaozi", evolved from promissory notes that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money, and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan Dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled "How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country." Banknotes were first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins. The gold standard, a monetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th-19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made legal tender, and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.</p>
	<p> After World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference, most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the U.S. government suspended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. According to proponents of modern money theory, fiat money is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for the currency they issue.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Functions</h4>
	<p> In Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a medium of exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet:</p>
	<p> Money's a matter of functions four, A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.</p>
	<p> This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks. Most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, not considering a standard of deferred payment as it is a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.</p>
	<p> There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate. Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term "financial capital" is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Medium of exchange</h3>
	<p> When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a medium of exchange. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the "coincidence of wants" problem. Money's most important usage is as a method for comparing the values of dissimilar objects.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Measure of value</h3>
	<p> A unit of account (in economics) is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or "standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.</p>
	<p> Money acts as a standard measure and common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Standard of deferred payment</h3>
	<p> While standard of deferred payment is distinguished by some texts, particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions. A "standard of deferred payment" is an accepted way to settle a debt – a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as legal tender, in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation, and for sovereign and international debts via debasement and devaluation.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Store of value</h3>
	<p> To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Money supply</h4>
	<p> In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any financial instrument that can fulfill the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the money supply of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.</p>
	<p> Modern monetary theory distinguishes among different ways to measure the money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.</p>
	<p> Another measure of money, M0, is also used; unlike the other measures, it does not represent actual purchasing power by firms and households in the economy. M0 is base money, or the amount of money actually issued by the central bank of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the reserve requirements of commercial banks.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Market liquidity</h2>
	<p> "Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to trade goods and services easily without having to barter.</p>
	<p> Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low transaction costs. There should be no (or minimal) spread between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Types</h3>
	<p> Currently, most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by representative money, such as the gold standard, as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since the breakup of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Commodity</h4>
	<p> Many items have been used as commodity money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content. American Eagles are imprinted with their gold content and legal tender face value.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Representative</h2>
	<p> In 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the money used at the time as "representative money". Representative money is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Fiat</h3>
	<p> Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.) to be legal tender, making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.</p>
	<p> Some bullion coins such as the Australian Gold Nugget and American Eagle are legal tender, however, they trade based on the market price of the metal content as a commodity, rather than their legal tender face value (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).</p>
	<p> Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins) can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed. By contrast, commodity money which has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Coinage</h3>
	<p> These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with.</p>
	<p> In most major economies using coinage, copper, silver and gold formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. In Europe, this system worked through the medieval period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest. Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Paper</h3>
	<p> In premodern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of paper money, commonly known today as banknotes. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang Dynasty (618–907) into the Song Dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as promissory notes from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the Song Dynasty government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.</p>
	<p> At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, promissory notes, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits.</p>
	<p> In Europe, paper money was first introduced in Sweden in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of stock in joint stock companies, and the redemption of those shares in paper.</p>
	<p> However, these advantages held within them disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.</p>
	<p> At this time both silver and gold were considered legal tender, and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the instability in the ratio between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called bimetallism and the attempt to create a bimetallic standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States Greenback, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.</p>
	<p> Banknotes with a face value of 5000 of different currencies</p>
	<p> By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's Law: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.</p>
	<p> No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable gold standard or silver standard currency system.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Commercial bank</h3>
	<p> Commercial bank money or demand deposits are claims against financial institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.</p>
	<p> Commercial bank money is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking practice where banks keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money creation by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the broad money supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of base money created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the money multiplier) is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.</p>
	<p> The money supply of a country is usually held to be the total amount of currency in circulation plus the total value of checking and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Electronic or digital</h3>
	<p> Many digital currencies, in particular Flooz and Beenz, had gained momentum before the Dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. Not much innovation occurred until the conception of Bitcoin in 2009, which introduced the concept of a cryptocurrency.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Monetary policy</h4>
	<p> When gold and silver are used as money, the money supply can grow only if the supply of these metals is increased by mining. This rate of increase will accelerate during periods of gold rushes and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the New World and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was discovered in California in 1848. This causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down. However, if the rate of gold mining cannot keep up with the growth of the economy, gold becomes relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) will drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
	<p> Modern day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The control of the amount of money in the economy is known as monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process by which a government, central bank, or monetary authority manages the money supply to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the Federal Reserve Act that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee should seek "to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."</p>
	<p> A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include hyperinflation, stagflation, recession, high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
	<p> Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and free market approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money supply include:</p>
	<p> changing the interest rate at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from) the commercial banks</p>
	<p> • currency purchases or sales</p>
	<p> • increasing or lowering government borrowing</p>
	<p> • increasing or lowering government spending</p>
	<p> • manipulation of exchange rates</p>
	<p> • raising or lowering bank reserve requirements</p>
	<p> • regulation or prohibition of private currencies</p>
	<p> • taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country</p>
	<p> In the US, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the Euro area the respective institution is the European Central Bank. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the Bank of Japan, People's Bank of China and the Bank of England.</p>
	<p> For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an economic theory known as monetarism. Monetarism is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz supported by the work of David Laidler, and many others. The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors and the influence of monetarism has since decreased.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Counterfeit</h4>
	<p> Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of Lydian coins which are thought to be among the first western coins. Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called Superdollars because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of Euro banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Laundering</h4>
	<p> Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets. However, in a number of legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing, tax evasion and evading of international sanctions.</p>`

	<p> Their variety with regard to many people of the world depends on the climate, religion, laws, government, needs, education, manners and examples. In each nation where one of these factors acts with more force, the others succumb to it.</p>
	<p> In order to verify all these truths, we will enter in the level of detail that this work will permit; but looking only at the different forms of government in temperate climates, we can deduce this consideration quite clearly through the morals of its citizens. Thus, in a republic that can only subsist through economic commerce, the simplicity of the morals , religious tolerance, love of frugality, thrift, self-interest and of avarice, should definitely dominate. In a limited monarchy, where each citizen takes part in the administration of the state, liberty will be regarded as a very great good, for which all wars will be undertaken and will not even be considered a bad thing; the people of this monarchy will be proud, generous, knowledgeable in the sciences and in politics, never losing sight of their privileges, even those of leisure and debauchery. In a rich absolute monarchy, where the women prescribe the tenor, honor, ambition, gallantry, taste for pleasures, vanity, softness, will be the distinctive characteristics of the subjects; and as this government produces idleness, this idleness corrupts the morals , giving birth in their place to the politeness of morals.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Morality (from the Latin moralis "manner, character, proper behavior") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper. Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with "goodness" or "rightness".</p>
	<p> Moral philosophy includes moral ontology, or the origin of morals, as well as moral epistemology, or knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including deontological ethical systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and normative ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states that: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself."</p>
	<p> Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any set of moral standards or principles.</p>

	<p> Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality. The word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual." Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially deontological ethics, sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: "Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct, reserving ethics for the more Aristotelian approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a virtue, and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations."</p>

	<p> In its descriptive sense, "morality" refers to personal or cultural values, codes of conduct or social mores from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. Descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.</p>
	<p> In its normative sense, "morality" refers to whatever (if anything) is actually right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. Normative ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Realism and anti-realism</h3>
	<p> Philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of meta-ethics) are broadly divided into two classes:</p>
	<p> • Moral realism is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social conformity significantly shape individuals' "moral" decisions, they deny that those cultural norms and customs define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by ethical naturalists, however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. ethical non-naturalists).</p>
	<p> • Moral anti-realism, on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts (error theory); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts (ethical subjectivism); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command (non-cognitivism).</p>
	<p> Some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with moral universalism. For example, universal prescriptivism is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and divine command theory and ideal observer theory are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.</p>

	<h4> Anthropology</h4>
	<h3> Tribal and territorial</h3>
	<p> Celia Green made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality. She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as Kant's 'categorical imperative' and Geisler's graded absolutism. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> In-group and out-group</h3>
	<p> Some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an "in-group" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same culture or race) or an "out-group" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution. In simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group. Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary. Jonathan Haidt has noted that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by conservatives, but far less so by liberals.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Comparing cultures</h3>
	<p> Peterson and Seligman approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include wisdom / knowledge; courage; humanity; justice; temperance; and transcendence. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance humanity includes love, kindness, and social intelligence.</p>
	<p> Fons Trompenaars, author of Did the Pedestrian Die?, tested members of different cultures with various moral dilemmas. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.</p>
	<p> John Newton, author of Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century compared the Eastern and the Western cultures about morality. As stated in Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century, "One of the important objectives of this book is to blend harmoniously the fine souls regarding conduct in the Eastern and the Western cultures, to take the result as the source and then to create newer and better conduct principles to suit the human society of the new century, and to introduce a lot of Chinese fine conduct spirits to the Western world. It is hoped that this helps solve lots of problems the human society of the 21st century faces, including (but not limited to the Eastern and the Western cultures) what a single culture cannot."</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Evolution</h4>
	<p> The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to sociocultural evolution. Some evolutionary biologists, particularly sociobiologists, believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival and/or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved "pro-social" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.</p>
	<p> On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.</p>
	<p> On this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction (inclusive fitness). Examples: the maternal bond is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the Westermarck effect, where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins taboos against incest because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as inbreeding.</p>
	<p> The phenomenon of reciprocity in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some vampire bats fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)</p>
	<p> Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as "a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups." This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness. In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts. They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics prototypical of our own tendencies for gossip and reputation management.</p>
	<p> Christopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout hominid evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons. Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of theory of mind abilities.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Neuroscience</h4>
	<p> The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by a quantitative large-scale meta-analysis of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature. In fact, the neural network underlying moral decisions overlapped with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons' points of view and to grasping others' feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Brain areas</h3>
	<p> The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the temporoparietal junction area.</p>
	<p> Stimulation of the VMPC by transcranial magnetic stimulation, has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.</p>
	<p> Similarly VMPC-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Mirror neurons</h3>
	<p> Mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action. The neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed, causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action. Research on mirror neurons, since their discovery in 1996, suggests that they may have a role to play not only in action understanding, but also in emotion sharing empathy. Cognitive neuro-scientist Jean Decety thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior, and ultimately, morality. The inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathy, and this would appear to lend support to Decety's view.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Psychology</h4>
	<p> In modern moral psychology, morality is considered to change through personal development. A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. Lawrence Kohlberg, Jean Piaget, and Elliot Turiel have cognitive-developmental approaches to moral development; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. Social psychologists such as Martin Hoffman and Jonathan Haidt emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as empathy. Moral identity theorists, such as William Damon and Mordechai Nisan, see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud, who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the super-ego as guilt-shame avoidance.</p>
	<p> Because we are naturally prone to be empathic and moral, we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes, we still, at least occasionally, engage in immoral behavior. Such behaviors jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviors we still feel as though we are moral individuals. Moral self-licensing attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behavior. When our moral self-image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behavior. The more confident we are, the less we will worry about our future behavior which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviors.Monin and Miller (2001) examined the moral self-licensing effect and found that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Morality and politics</h4>
	<p> If morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges. It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham have studied the differences between liberals and conservatives, in this regard. Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to port-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.</p>
	<p> Group morality develops from shared concepts and beliefs and is often codified to regulate behavior within a culture or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess "moral fiber", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of Cistercian reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the Dowager Empress in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within nationalist movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content. Political Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. Noam Chomsky states that</p>
	<p> ... if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil. In fact, one of the, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Morality and religion</h4>
	<p> Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is "an almost automatic assumption". According to The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics, religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Positions</h3>
	<p> Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious value systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, humanism, utilitarianism, and others. There are many types of religious value systems. Modern monotheistic religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and to a certain degree others such as Sikhism and Zoroastrianism, define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning pantheistic to nontheistic tend to be less absolute. For example, within Buddhism, the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong. A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by Barbara Stoler Miller, who states that, in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand".</p>
	<p> Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in Hinduism, which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances. In monotheistic traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as abortion or divorce.[a] Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher David Hume stated that, "the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."</p>
	<p> Religious value systems can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on murder, mass atrocities, and slavery. For example, Simon Blackburn states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels". In regard to Christianity, he states that the "Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women", and notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well. Christian apologists address Blackburn's viewpoints and construe that Jewish laws in the Jewish Bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property. Elizabeth Anderson holds that "the Bible contains both good and evil teachings", and it is "morally inconsistent". Humanists like Paul Kurtz believe that we can identify moral values across cultures, even if we do not appeal to a supernatural or universalist understanding of principles - values including integrity, trustworthiness, benevolence, and fairness. These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Empirical analyses</h4>
	<p> A number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime." Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, Society without God, notes that Denmark and Sweden, "which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world  the lowest levels of corruption in the world".</p>
	<p> Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the Journal of Religion and Society stated that, "In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" Portugal. In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. His conclusion is that a "complex relationship" exists between religiosity and homicide "with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it". On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Kingdom of Morocco, African kingdom in the westernmost part of Barbary. It is bordered to the north by the Ommirabi river, to the east by Mount Atlas, to the south by the Sus river, and to the west by the ocean. This kingdom extends across the whole length of the coast from the mouth of the Sus river, which the ancients called Suriga , to the city of Azamor.</p>
	<p> The forces of this kingdom are hardly formidable by sea, since the number of vessels, which are poorly equipped is typically only a dozen, each with 15-20 badly outfitted cannons. If they seize any prizes, the king takes half, but he takes possession of all the slaves, paying 50 crowns for each that isn’t already included in his half.</p>
	<p> The land forces are no better than those at sea, because they have neither arms nor discipline.</p>
	<p> Although the kingdom of Morocco is divided into seven fairly large provinces, it is nevertheless very sparsely populated due to its sandy and infertile land, which doesn’t support an abundance of grain or livestock; it only produces a significant quantity of beeswax and almonds, which are then sold in Europe.</p>
	<p> In the whole country, one can count 25,000-30,000 huts arranged in adouards, which comprise 80-100 thousand men paying an annual tithe to the king from the age of 15. An adouard is a kind of itinerant village consisting of several Arab families who make camp in tents, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; each adouard has its own holy man and its own chief, who is elected. Nothing is comparable to the poverty and filth of these Arabs.</p>
	<p> The king of Morocco assumes the title of Grand Sharif , which means the first successor of Mohammed, from whom he claims descent through Ali and Fatima, son and daughter of this false prophet.</p>
	<p> His religion, full of superstitions, is based on the Qu’ran, which the Moors and the Arabs understand in their own way according to the interpretation of Melich.</p>
	<p> Although Christian slaves belong to the king as well, the harshness of their labor, their bad food, and the underground quarters in which they sleep make them no less miserable.</p>
	<p> The Jews, although productive and numerous in this state, are fleeced there as they used to be among the Christians.</p>
	<p> The commanders govern the kingdom under the authority of the Sharif, because he has neither a court of justice nor a privy council nor ministers; he is the author, the interpreter, and the judge of his laws. In his kingdom of Morocco , as in China, he gives the rights to the empire by his testament in favor of whichever of his children he wishes to name, or even of another subject as his successor. Thus factions can be formed during the life of the monarch, and if he does not leave a will, or if he does not name a successor in his will, all is ready for discord and civil war.</p>
	<p> I would like to add that the king of Morocco, despite his despotism, recognizes in religious matters the superior authority of the Mufti and his priests. He does not have the power to depose them, although he had the power to install them; however, if they tried to obstruct his plans, his vengeance would be certain and their ruin inevitable, unless they deposed him at that moment.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Morocco (Listeni/məˈrɒkoʊ/; Arabic: المغرب‎‎ al-Maghrib, lit. "The West"; Lmeɣrib; French: Maroc), officially known as the Kingdom of Morocco (Arabic: المملكة المغربية‎‎ al-Mamlakah al-Maghribiyah, lit. "The Western Kingdom"; Berber: Tageldit n Lmaɣrib), is a sovereign country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa. Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.</p>
	<p> Morocco has a population of over 33.8 million and an area of 446,550 km2 (172,410 sq mi). Its capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca. Other major cities include Marrakesh, Tangier, Tetouan, Salé, Fes, Agadir, Meknes, Oujda, Kenitra, and Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and Northwestern Africa. Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North African country to avoid Ottoman occupation. The Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates, with an international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.</p>
	<p> Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.</p>
	<p> Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of the Constitutional court.</p>
	<p> Morocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Tamazight. The Moroccan dialect, referred to as Darija, and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is a member of the Arab League, the Union for the Mediterranean, and the African Union. It has the fifth largest economy of Africa.</p>
	<p> Etymology</p>
	<p> The full Arabic name al-Mamlakah al-Maghribiyyah (المملكة المغربية) translates to "Kingdom of the West"; although "the West" in Arabic is الغرب Al-Gharb. For historical references, medieval Arab historians and geographers sometimes referred to Morocco as al-Maghrib al-Aqṣá (المغرب الأقصى, meaning "The Farthest West") to distinguish it from neighbouring historical regions called al-Maghrib al-Awsaṭ (المغرب الأوسط, meaning "The Middle West") and al-Maghrib al-Adná (المغرب الأدنى, meaning "The Nearest West").[12]</p>
	<p> The basis of Morocco's English name is Marrakesh, its capital under the Almoravid dynasty and Almohad Caliphate.[13] The origin of the name Marrakesh is disputed,[14] but is most likely from the Berber words amur (n) akush (ⴰⵎⵓⵔ ⵏ ⴰⴽⵓⵛ) or "Land of God".[15] The modern Berber name for Marrakesh is Mṛṛakc (in the Berber Latin script). In Turkish, Morocco is known as Fas, a name derived from its ancient capital of Fes. However, this was not the case in other parts of the Islamic world: until the middle of the 20th century, the common name of Morocco in Egyptian and Middle Eastern Arabic literature was Marrakes (مراكش); this name is still used in some languages such as Persian, Urdu, Punjabi and Pashto. The English name Morocco is an anglicisation of the Spanish Marruecos.</p>
	<p> History</p>
	<p> Main article: History of Morocco</p>
	<p> Prehistory and antiquity</p>
	<p> The Berber Roman client King Ptolemy of Mauretania.</p>
	<p> The area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since Paleolithic times, sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC.[16] During the Upper Paleolithic, the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today, resembling a savanna more than today's arid landscape.[17] Twenty-two thousand years ago, the Aterian was succeeded by the Iberomaurusian culture, which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. Skeletal similarities have been suggested between the Iberomaurusian "Mechta-Afalou" burials and European Cro-Magnon remains. The Iberomaurusian was succeeded by the Beaker culture in Morocco.</p>
	<p> Mitochondrial DNA studies have discovered a close link between Berbers and the Saami of Scandinavia. This supports theories that the Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe was the source of late-glacial expansions of hunter-gatherers who repopulated northern Europe after the last ice age.[18]</p>
	<p> North Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging Mediterranean world by the Phoenicians, who established trading colonies and settlements in the early Classical period. Substantial Phoenician settlements were at Chellah, Lixus and Mogador.[19] Mogador was a Phoenician colony as early as the early 6th century BC.[20][page needed]</p>
	<p> Ancient Roman ruins of Volubilis.</p>
	<p> Morocco later became a realm of the North African civilisation of ancient Carthage as part of its empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the Berber kingdom of Mauretania under king Baga.[21] This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the present state of Mauritania) dates at least to 225 BC.</p>
	<p> Mauretania became a client kingdom of the Roman Empire in 33 BC. Emperor Claudius annexed Mauretania directly as a Roman province in 44 AD, under an imperial governor (either aprocurator Augusti, or a legatus Augusti pro praetore).</p>
	<p> During the crisis of the 3rd century, parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities (such as Septum (Ceuta) in Mauretania Tingitana and Cherchell in Mauretania Caesariensis) by the late 3rd century.</p>
	<p> Early Islamic era</p>
	<p> The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, that started in the middle of the 7th century, was achieved early into the following century. It brought both the Arabic language and Islam to the area. Although part of the larger Islamic Empire, Morocco was initially organized as a subsidiary province of Ifriqiya, with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in Kairouan.[22]</p>
	<p> The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their customary laws. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration.[23] The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the Kingdom of Nekor, an emirate in the Rif Mountains. It was founded by Salih I ibn Mansur in 710, as a client state to the Rashidun Caliphate. After the outbreak of the Berber Revolt in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the Miknasa of Sijilmasa and the Barghawata.</p>
	<p> According to medieval legend, Idris ibn Abdallah had fled to Morocco after the Abbasids' massacre of his tribe in Iraq. He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established Fes as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major regional power. The Idrissids were ousted in 927 by the Fatimid Caliphate and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the Maghrawa of Sijilmasa in 980.</p>
	<p> Berber dynasties</p>
	<p> The Almohad realm at its greatest extent, c. 1212</p>
	<p> From the 11th century onwards, a series of powerful Berber[24][25][26] dynasties arose. Under the Almoravid dynasty [27] and the Almohad dynasty, Morocco dominated the Maghreb, much of present-day Spain and Portugal, and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onwards the country saw a massive migration of Banu Hilal Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Merinids held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the Wattasids. In the 15th century, the Reconquista ended Muslim rule in central and southern Spain and many Muslims and Jews fled to Morocco.[28]</p>
	<p> Portuguese efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco even though they managed to control some possessions on the Moroccan coast but not venturing further afield inland.</p>
	<p> On another note and according to Elizabeth Allo Isichei, "In 1520, there was a famine in Morocco so terrible that for a long time other events were dated by it. It has been suggested that the population of Morocco fell from 5 to under 3 million between the early sixteenth and nineteenth centuries."[29]</p>

	<p> In 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the Islamic prophet, Muhammad: first the Saadi dynasty who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the Alaouite Dynasty, who remained in power since the 17th century.</p>
	<p> Under the Saadi Dynasty, the country repulsed Ottoman incursions and a Portuguese invasion at the battle of Ksar el Kebir in 1578. The reign of Ahmad al-Mansur brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the Songhay Empire in 1591. However, managing the territories across the Sahara proved too difficult. After the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.</p>
	<p> In 1666, Morocco was reunited by the Alaouite Dynasty, who have been the ruling house of Morocco ever since. Morocco was facing aggression from Spain and the Ottoman Empire allies pressing westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727) began to create a unified state.[30] With his Jaysh d'Ahl al-Rif (the Riffian Army) he seized Tangier from the English in 1684 and drove the Spanish from Larache in 1689.</p>
	<p> Morocco was the first nation to recognise the fledgling United States as an independent nation in 1777.[31][32][33] In the beginning of the American Revolution, American merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean were subject to attack by the Barbary pirates. On 20 December 1777, Morocco's Sultan Mohammed III declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship, signed in 1786, stands as the U.S.'s oldest non-broken friendship treaty.[34][35]</p>
	<p> French and Spanish protectorates</p>
	<p> Death of Spanish general Margallo during the Melilla War. Le Petit Journal, 13 November 1893.</p>
	<p> Main articles: French Morocco and Spanish Protectorate in Morocco</p>
	<p> As Europe industrialised, North Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco on two oceans.[36] In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war. Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.</p>
	<p> In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire; and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered the 1912 Fez riots.[37] Spain continued to operate its coastal protectorate. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones.[38]</p>
	<p> Tens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco. Some bought up large amounts of the rich agricultural land, others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco – a control which was also made necessary by the continuous wars among Moroccan tribes, part of which had taken sides with the French since the beginning of the conquest. Governor general, Marshall Hubert Lyautey, sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan-French administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers (Goumiers or regular troops and officers) served in the French army in both World War I and World War II, and in the Spanish Nationalist Army in the Spanish Civil War and after (Regulares).[39] The institution of slavery was abolished in 1925.[40]</p>
	<p> Tangier's population included 40,000 Muslims, 31,000 Europeans and 15,000 Jews.[41]</p>
	<p> Between 1921 and 1926, a Berber uprising in the Rif Mountains, led by Abd el-Krim, led to the establishment of the Republic of the Rif. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by French and Spanish troops.</p>
	<p> In 1943, the Istiqlal Party (Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support. That party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.</p>
	<p> France's exile of Sultan Mohammed V in 1953 to Madagascar and his replacement by the unpopular Mohammed Ben Aarafa sparked active opposition to the French and Spanish protectorates. The most notable violence occurred in Oujda where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.[42] In March 1956 the French protectorate was ended and Morocco regained its independence from France as the "Kingdom of Morocco". A month later Spain ceded most of its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves (Ceuta and Melilla) on the Mediterranean coast. Sultan Mohammed became king in 1957.</p>
	<p> Post-independence</p>
	<p> The Mausoleum of Mohammed V in Rabat.</p>
	<p> Upon the death of Mohammed V, Hassan II became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first general elections in 1963. However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971, there was a failed attempt to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.</p>
	<p> The Spanish enclave of Ifni in the south was returned to Morocco in 1969. The Polisario movement was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara. On 6 November 1975 King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the "Green March".[43] A month later, Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria. Moroccan forces occupied the territory.[28]</p>
	<p> Moroccan and Algerian troops soon clashed in Western Sahara. Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco. In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984, Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the SADR's admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000 Moroccan soldiers between 1982 and 1985.</p>
	<p> Algerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000.[44] Diplomatic relations with Algeria were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a proposed referendum on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.</p>
	<p> Political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997 and Morocco's first opposition-led government came to power in 1998.</p>
	<p> Protestors in Casablanca demand that authorities honor their promises of political reform.</p>
	<p> King Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son, Mohammed VI. He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation.[45]</p>
	<p> Mohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002. Morocco unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007. The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal. Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital El Aaiún.</p>
	<p> In 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil. Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005 as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006 the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King Juan Carlos I visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.</p>
	<p> During the 2011–12 Moroccan protests, thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the Arab Spring protests. Despite the reforms made by Mohamed VI demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.</p>
	<p> Geography</p>
	<p> Main article: Geography of Morocco</p>
	<p> High Atlas in central Morocco</p>
	<p> Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa, at 4,167 m (13,671 ft)</p>
	<p> Morocco has a coast by the Atlantic Ocean that reaches past the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Spain to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled exclaves, Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera), Algeria to the east, and Western Sahara to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its de facto southern boundary is with Mauritania.</p>
	<p> The internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes 27° and 36°N, and longitudes 1° and 14°W. Adding Western Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between 21° and 36°N, and 1° and 17°W (the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula is slightly south of 21° and west of 17°).</p>
	<p> The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a Northern African country, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with Spain and France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.</p>
	<p> A large part of Morocco is mountainous. The Atlas Mountains are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The Rif Mountains are located in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the Berber people. At 446,550 km2 (172,414 sq mi), Morocco is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world (after Uzbekistan). Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.</p>
	<p> Spanish territory in North Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: Ceuta, Melilla, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, Peñón de Alhucemas, the Chafarinas islands, and the disputed islet Perejil. Off the Atlantic coast the Canary Islands belong to Spain, whereas Madeira to the north is Portuguese. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded transit passage between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>
	<p> The Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country, from the northeast to the south west. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the Sahara Desert and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south lies the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in 1975 (see Green March).[46] Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its Southern Provinces.</p>
	<p> Morocco's capital city is Rabat; its largest city is its main port, Casablanca. Other cities include Agadir, Essaouira, Fes, Marrakesh, Meknes, Mohammedia, Oujda, Ouarzazat, Safi, Salé, Tangier and Tétouan.</p>
	<p> Morocco is represented in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 geographical encoding standard by the symbol MA.[47] This code was used as the basis for Morocco's internet domain, .ma.[47]</p>
	<p> Climate</p>
	<p> Köppen climate types in Morocco</p>
	<p> Overview:</p>
	<p> The country's Mediterranean climate is similar to that of southern California, with lush forests in the northern and central mountain ranges of the country, giving way to drier conditions and inland deserts further southeast. The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold Canary Current off its Atlantic coast.</p>
	<p> In the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree endemic to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.</p>
	<p> Southeast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the Sahara Desert, where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush oases.</p>
	<p> In contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal plains are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes from Morocco a country of contrasts. Forested areas cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.</p>
	<p> Landscape of the Erg Chebbi</p>
	<p> Atlas Mountains</p>
	<p> In general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus we have the following climate zones:</p>
	<p> Mediterranean: It dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500 km strip), and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are between 29 °C (84.2 °F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F). Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average temperatures hover around 9 °C (48.2 °F) to 11 °C (51.8 °F), and average low are around 5 °C (41.0 °F) to 8 °C (46.4 °F), typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation in this area vary from 600–800 mm in the west to 350–500 mm in the east. Notable cities that fall into this zone are Tangier, Tetouan, Al Hoceima, Nador and Safi.</p>
	<p> Sub-Mediterranean: It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:</p>
	<p> -Oceanic: Determined by the cooler summers, where highs rarely go above 27 °C (80.6 °F) and in terms of Essaouira region are almost always around 21 °C (69.8 °F). The medium daily temperatures can get as low as 19 °C (66.2 °F), while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700 mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are Rabat, Casablanca, Kénitra, Salé and Essaouira.</p>
	<p> -Continental: Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as 40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F). However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below 20 °C (68.0 °F), and sometimes as low as 10 °C (50.0 °F) in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also snow can fall occasionally. Fès for example registered −8 °C (17.6 °F) in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900 mm. Notable cities are Fès, Meknès, Chefchaouen, Beni-Mellal and Taza.</p>
	<p> Continental It dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F). Winters on the other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures can easily break −10 °C (14.0 °F). It often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800 mm. Notable cities are Khenifra, Imilchil, Midelt and Azilal.</p>
	<p> Alpine: This type of climate is found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200 mm. In summer highs barely go above 30 °C (86.0 °F), and lows are cool and go well beyond 15 °C (59.0 °F). In winters, highs rarely go above 8 °C (46.4 °F), and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of country, there are many ski resorts, such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen. Notable cities are Ifrane, Azrou and Boulmane.</p>
	<p> Semi-arid: This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350 mm. However, One usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are Agadir, Marrakesh and Oujda.</p>
	<p> South of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.</p>
	<p> Note: Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7–8 degrees Celsius when sirocco blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7–8 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena don't last for more than 2 to 5 days on average.</p>
	<p> Countries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are California (USA), Portugal, Spain and Algeria.</p>
	<p> Precipitation:</p>
	<p> Annual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500 mm and 1200 mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600 mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700 mm and up to 3500 mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300 mm and 500 mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250 mm and 400 mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250 mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100 mm and 200 mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.</p>
	<p> Botanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.</p>
	<p> Morocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.</p>
	<p> Biodiversity</p>
	<p> An adult male Barbary macaque carrying his offspring, a behaviour rarely found in other primates.</p>
	<p> Morocco has a wide range of biodiversity. It is part of the Mediterranean basin, an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority.[48] Avifauna are notably variant.[49] The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of 454 species, five of which have been introduced by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen.[50]</p>
	<p> The Barbary lion, hunted to extinction in the wild, was a subspieces native to Morocco and is a national emblem.[1] The last Barbary lion in the wild was shot in the Atlas Mountains in 1922.[51] The other two primary predators of northern Africa, the Atlas bear and Barbary leopard, are now extinct and critically endangered, respectively. Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Draa river until the 20th century.[52]</p>
	<p> The Barbary macaque, a primate endemic to Morocco and Algeria, is also facing extinction due to offtake for trade[53] human interruption, urbanisation, wood and real estate expansion that diminish forested area – the macaque's habitat.</p>
	<p> Trade of animals and plants for food, pets, medicinal purposes, souvenirs and photo props is common across Morocco, despite laws making much of it illegal.[54][55] This trade is unregulated and causing unknown reductions of wild populations of native Moroccan wildlife. Because of the proximity of northern Morocco to Europe, species such as cacti, tortoises, mammal skins, and high-value birds (falcons and bustards) are harvested in various parts of the country and exported in appreciable quantities, with especially large volumes of eel harvested – 60 tons exported to the Far East in the period 2009‒2011.[56]</p>
	<p> Politics</p>
	<p> Main article: Politics of Morocco</p>
	<p> The King of Morocco, Mohammed VI.</p>
	<p> Morocco was an authoritarian regime according to the Democracy Index of 2014. The Freedom of the Press 2014 report gave it a rating of "Not Free".</p>
	<p> Following the March 1998 elections, a coalition government headed by opposition socialist leader Abderrahmane Youssoufi and composed largely of ministers drawn from opposition parties, was formed. Prime Minister Youssoufi's government was the first ever government drawn primarily from opposition parties, and also represents the first opportunity for a coalition of socialists, left-of-centre, and nationalist parties to be included in the government until October 2002. It was also the first time in the modern political history of the Arab world that the opposition assumed power following an election.[citation needed] The current government is headed by Abdelilah Benkirane.</p>
	<p> The Moroccan Constitution provides for a monarchy with a Parliament and an independent judiciary. With the 2011 constitutional reforms, the King of Morocco retains less executive powers whereas those of the prime minister have been enlarged.[57][58]</p>
	<p> The constitution grants the king honorific powers; he is both the secular political leader and the "Commander of the Faithful" as a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. He presides over the Council of Ministers; appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, and on recommendations from the latter, appoints the members of the government.</p>
	<p> The previous constitution of 1996 theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister, and after consultation with the heads of the higher and lower Assemblies, to dissolve the Parliament, suspend the constitution, call for new elections, or rule by decree, the only time this happened was in 1965. The King is formally the chief of the military.</p>
	<p> Legislative branch</p>
	<p> The legislature's building in Rabat.</p>
	<p> Since the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The Assembly of Representatives of Morocco (Majlis an-Nuwwâb/Assemblée des Répresentants) has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat constituencies and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The Assembly of Councillors (Majlis al-Mustasharin) has 270 members, elected for a nine-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats).</p>
	<p> The Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include budgetary matters, approving bills, questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a vote of no confidence.</p>
	<p> The latest parliamentary elections were held on November 25, 2011, and were considered by some neutral observers to be mostly free and fair. Voter turnout in these elections was estimated to be 43% of registered voters.</p>

	<p> Main article: Royal Moroccan Armed Forces</p>
	<p> Compulsory military service in Morocco has been officially suspended since September 2006, and Morocco's reserve obligation lasts until age 50. Morocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces—this includes the Army (the largest branch), the Navy, the Air Force, the Royal Guard, the Royal Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Forces. Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare (with one exception, the 2003 Casablanca bombings which killed 45 people[59]).</p>
	<p> The UN maintains a small observer force in Western Sahara, where a large number of Morocco's troops are stationed. The Saharawi group Polisario maintains an active militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters in Western Sahara and has engaged in intermittent warfare with Moroccan forces since the 1970s.</p>
	<p> Foreign relations</p>
	<p> Main article: Foreign relations of Morocco</p>
	<p> Morocco is a member of the United Nations and belongs to the Arab League, Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN_SAD). Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits.[60] France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco. From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the European Union invests approximately 73.5%, whereas, the Arab world invests only 19.3%. Many countries from the Persian Gulf and Maghreb regions are getting more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco.[61]</p>
	<p> Morocco claims sovereignty over Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.</p>
	<p> Morocco was the only African state not to be a member of the African Union due to its unilateral withdrawal on 12 November 1984 over the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1982 by the African Union (then called Organisation of African Unity) as a full member without the organisation of a referendum of self-determination in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Morocco rejoined the AU on 30 January 2017.[62][63]</p>
	<p> A dispute with Spain in 2002 over the tiny island of Perejil revived the issue of the sovereignty of Melilla and Ceuta. These small enclaves on the Mediterranean coast are surrounded by Morocco and have been administered by Spain for centuries.</p>
	<p> Morocco has been given the status of major non-NATO ally by the US government. Morocco was the first country in the world to recognise US sovereignty (in 1777).</p>

	<p> Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1975. The Polisario Front control the territory east of the Moroccan berm (wall).</p>
	<p> Due to the conflict over Western Sahara, the status of the Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro regions is disputed. The Western Sahara War saw the Polisario Front, the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991 that is still in effect. A United Nations mission, MINURSO, is tasked with organizing a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.</p>
	<p> Part of the territory, the Free Zone, is a mostly uninhabited area that the Polisario Front controls as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Its administrative headquarters are located in Tindouf, Algeria. As of 2006, no UN member state has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.[64]</p>
	<p> In 2006, the government of Morocco has suggested autonomous status for the region, through the Moroccan Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS). The project was presented to the United Nations Security Council in mid-April 2007. The proposal was encouraged by Moroccan allies such as the United States, France and Spain.[65] The Security Council has called upon the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.[66]</p>

	<p> Economy</p>
	<p> Main article: Economy of Morocco</p>
	<p> A proportional representation of Morocco's exports.</p>
	<p> Morocco's economy is considered a relatively liberal economy governed by the law of supply and demand. Since 1993, the country has followed a policy of privatisation of certain economic sectors which used to be in the hands of the government.[69] Morocco has become a major player in the African economic affairs,[70] and is the 5th African economy by GDP (PPP). Morocco was ranked the 1st African country by the Economist Intelligence Unit' quality-of-life index, ahead of South Africa. However, Morocco has since then slipped into fourth place behind Egypt, but ahead of Angola.</p>
	<p> Government reforms and steady yearly growth in the region of 4–5% from 2000 to 2007, including 4.9% year-on-year growth in 2003–2007 helped the Moroccan economy to become much more robust compared to a few years ago. For 2012 the World Bank forecasts a rate of 4% growth for Morocco and 4.2% for following year, 2013.[71]</p>
	<p> The services sector accounts for just over half of GDP and industry, made up of mining, construction and manufacturing, is an additional quarter. The industries that recorded the highest growth are tourism, telecoms, information technology, and textile.</p>
	<p> Tourism</p>
	<p> Main article: Tourism in Morocco</p>
	<p> The Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech.</p>
	<p> Tourism is one of the most important sectors in Moroccan economy. It is well developed with a strong tourist industry focused on the country's coast, culture, and history. Morocco attracted more than 10 million tourists in 2013. Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco after the phosphate industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development, in 2010 the government launched its Vision 2020 which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20 million by 2020,[72] with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP.</p>
	<p> A large government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as a cheap and exotic, yet safe, place for tourists, most of the visitors to Morocco continue to be European, with French nationals making up almost 20% of all visitors. Most Europeans visit in April and the autumn, apart from the Spanish, who mostly visit in June and August In 2013. Morocco's relatively high amount of tourists has been aided by its location, Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches. Because of its proximity to Spain, tourists in southern Spain's coastal areas take one- to three-day trips to Morocco.</p>
	<p> Air services between Morocco and Algeria have been established, many Algerians have gone to Morocco to shop and visit family and friends. Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the dirham and the increase of hotel prices in Spain. Morocco has an excellent road and rail infrastructure that links the major cities and tourist destinations with ports and cities with international airports. Low-cost airlines offer cheap flights to the country.</p>

	<p> Tourism is increasingly focused on Morocco's culture, such as its ancient cities. The modern tourist industry capitalises on Morocco's ancient Roman and Islamic sites, and on its landscape and cultural history. 60% of Morocco's tourists visit for its culture and heritage. Agadir is a major coastal resort and has a third of all Moroccan bed nights. It is a base for tours to the Atlas Mountains. Other resorts in north Morocco are also very popular.[73]</p>
	<p> Casablanca is the major cruise port in Morocco, and has the best developed market for tourists in Morocco, Marrakech in central Morocco is a popular tourist destination, but is more popular among tourists for one- and two-day excursions that provide a taste of Morocco's history and culture. The Majorelle botanical garden in Marrakech is a popular tourist attraction. It was bought by the fashion designer Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé in 1980. Their presence in the city helped to boost the city's profile as a tourist destination.[74]</p>
	<p> As of 2006, activity and adventure tourism in the Atlas and Rif Mountains are the fastest growth area in Moroccan tourism. These locations have excellent walking and trekking opportunities from late March to mid-November. The government is investing in trekking circuits. They are also developing desert tourism in competition with Tunisia.[75]</p>
	<p> Agriculture</p>
	<p> Figuig oasis, with extensive date palm groves</p>
	<p> Agriculture accounts for around 14% of GDP and employs 40–45% of the Moroccan working population. With a semi-arid climate and an ill-developed irrigation system, it is difficult to assure enough irrigation.</p>
	<p> The major resources of the Moroccan economy are agriculture, phosphates, and tourism. Sales of fish and seafood are important as well. Industry and mining contribute about one-third of the annual GDP. Morocco is the world's third-largest producer of phosphorus after China and the United States,[76] and the price fluctuations of phosphates on the international market greatly influence Morocco's economy.</p>
	<p> Morocco suffers both from unemployment (9.6% in 2008), and a large external debt estimated at around $20 billion, or half of GDP in 2002.[77]</p>
	<p> Although Morocco runs a structural trade deficit, this is typically offset by substantial services earnings from tourism and large remittance inflows from the diaspora, and the country normally runs a small current-account surplus.[78]</p>
	<p> Energy</p>
	<p> Main article: Energy in Morocco</p>
	<p> Solar cell panels in eastern Morocco</p>
	<p> In 2008, about 56% of Morocco's electricity supply was provided by coal.[79] However, as forecasts indicate that energy requirements in Morocco will rise 6% per year between 2012 and 2050,[80] a new law passed encouraging Moroccans to look for ways to diversify the energy supply, including more renewable resources. The Moroccan government has launched a project to build a solar thermal energy power plant[81] and is also looking into the use of natural gas as a potential source of revenue for Morocco's government.[80]</p>
	<p> Morocco has embarked upon the construction of large solar energy farms to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, and to eventually export electricity to Europe.[82]</p>
	<p> Narcotics</p>
	<p> Since the 7th century, Cannabis has been cultivated in the Rif Region.[83] In 2004, according to the UN World Drugs Report, cultivation and transformation of Cannabis represents 0.57% of the national GDP of Morocco in 2002.[84] According to a French Ministry of the Interior 2006 report, 80% of the cannabis resin (hashish) consumed in Europe comes from the Rif region in Morocco, which is mostly mountainous terrain in the north of Morocco, also hosting plains that are very fertile and expanding from Melwiyya River and Ras Kebdana in the East to Tangier and Cape Spartel in the West. Also, the region extends from the Mediterranean in the south, home of the Wergha River, to the north. Also of note, this region hosts more "Riffians" with lighter hair, having a higher percentage of blondism than most other groups of Berbers, though the ancestry is likely mixed and quite similar.[85] In addition to that, Morocco is a transit point for cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe.[86]</p>
	<p> Transport</p>
	<p> Main article: Transport in Morocco</p>
	<p> There are around 56,986 km (35,409 mi) of roads (national, regional and provincial) in Morocco.[87] In addition to 1,416 km (880 mi) of highways.[88]</p>
	<p> The Tangier-Casablanca high-speed rail link marks the first stage of the ONCF's high-speed rail master plan, pursuant to which over 1,500 km (930 mi) of new railway lines will be built by 2035. The high speed train – TGV – will have a capacity of 500 passengers and will carry 8 million passengers per year. The work on the High Speed Rail project was started in September 2011.[89] Construction of infrastructure and delivery of railway equipment will end in 2014 and the HSR will be operational by December 2015.[90]</p>
	<p> Water supply and sanitation</p>
	<p> Main article: Water supply and sanitation in Morocco</p>
	<p> Water supply and sanitation in Morocco is provided by a wide array of utilities. They range from private companies in the largest city, Casablanca, the capital, Rabat, and two other cities, to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company (ONEE). The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.</p>
	<p> There have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighbourhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the National Human Development Initiative, under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.</p>
	<p> Demographics</p>
	<p> Most Moroccans are of Berber, Arab or Gnawa descent. There is a significant minority of Sub-Saharan African and European people. Arabs and Berbers together make up about 99.1% of the Moroccan population.[1] A sizeable portion of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnawa (or Gnaoua), black or mixed race descendants of slaves, and Moriscos, European Muslims expelled from Spain and Portugal in the 17th century.[92]</p>
	<p> Berbers are the indigenous people and still make up the bulk of the population, although they have been largely Arabised. Morocco is home to more than 20,000 sub-Saharan African immigrants.[93] Morocco's once prominent Jewish minority has decreased significantly since its peak of 265,000 in 1948, declining to around 2,500 today.[94]</p>
	<p> Most of foreign residents in Morocco are French or Spanish. Some of them are descendants of colonial settlers, who primarily work for European multinational companies, while others are married to Moroccans or are retirees. Prior to independence, Morocco was home to half a million Europeans; who were mostly Christians.[95] Also prior to independence, Morocco was home to 250,000 Spaniards.[96][97]</p>
	<p> Morocco has a large diaspora, most of which is located in France, which has reportedly over one million Moroccans of up to the third generation. There are also large Moroccan communities in Spain (about 700,000 Moroccans),[98] the Netherlands (360,000), and Belgium (300,000).[99] Other large communities can be found in Italy, Canada, the United States, and Israel, where Moroccan Jews are thought to constitute the second biggest Jewish ethnic subgroup.</p>
	<p> Religion</p>
	<p> The religious affiliation in the country was estimated by the Pew Forum in 2010 as 99% Muslim, with all remaining groups accounting for less than 1% of the population.[101] Sunnis form the majority at 67% with non-denominational Muslims being the second largest group of Muslims at 30%.[102] There are an estimated 3,000 to 8,000 Shia Muslims, most of them foreign residents from Lebanon or Iraq, but also a few citizen converts. Followers of several Sufi Muslim orders across the Maghreb and West Africa undertake joint annual pilgrimages to the country.</p>

	<p> Christians are estimated at 1% (~380,000) of the Moroccan population.[1] The predominantly Roman Catholic and Protestant foreign-resident Christian community consists of approximately 40,000 practising members. Most foreign resident Christians reside in the Casablanca, Tangier, and Rabat urban areas. Various local Christian leaders estimate that between 2005 and 2010 there are 5,000 citizen converted Christians (mostly ethnically Berber) who regularly attend "house" churches and live predominantly in the south.[103] Some local Christian leaders estimate that there may be as many as 8,000 Christian citizens throughout the country, but many reportedly do not meet regularly due to fear of government surveillance and social persecution.[104] The number of the Moroccans who converted to Christianity (most of them secret worshippers) are estimated between 8,000–40,000;[105][106] although some estimate the number to be as high as 150,000.[107][108]</p>
	<p> The most recent estimates put the size of the Casablanca Jewish community at about 2,500,[109] and the Rabat and Marrakesh Jewish communities at about 100 members each. The remainder of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the country. This population is mostly elderly, with a decreasing number of young persons.[104] The Baha’i community, located in urban areas, numbers 350 to 400 persons.[104]</p>
	<p> Languages</p>
	<p> Main article: Languages of Morocco</p>
	<p> A map of the ethnolinguistic groups in Morocco.</p>
	<p> Morocco's official languages are Arabic and Berber.[110][111] The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija. Approximately 89.8%[112] of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic. The Berber language is spoken in three dialects (Tarifit, Tashelhit and Central Atlas Tamazight).[113] In 2008, Frédéric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population.[114] The 2004 population census reported that 28.1% of the population spoke Berber.[112]</p>
	<p> French is widely used in governmental institutions, media, mid-size and large companies, international commerce with French-speaking countries, and often in international diplomacy. French is taught as an obligatory language at all schools. In 2010, there were 10,366,000 French-speakers in Morocco, or about 32% of the population.[115][Notes 1]</p>
	<p> According to the 2004 census, 2.19 million Moroccans spoke a foreign language other than French.[112] English, while far behind French in terms of number of speakers, is the first foreign language of choice, since French is obligatory, among educated youth and professionals.</p>
	<p> About 5 million Moroccans speak Spanish. Spanish is spoken by some Moroccans, especially in the northern regions.[116] Spanish is mostly spoken in northern Morocco and the Spanish Sahara because Spain had previously occupied those areas. Moroccans in regions formerly controlled by Spain watch Spanish television and have interactions in Spanish on a daily basis.[117]</p>
	<p> After Morocco declared independence in 1956, French and Arabic became the main languages of administration and education, causing the role of Spanish to decline.[117]</p>
	<p> Culture</p>
	<p> Main article: Culture of Morocco</p>
	<p> The Kasbah of Aït Benhaddou, built by the Berbers from the 14th century onwards.</p>
	<p> Morocco is an ethnically diverse country with a rich culture and civilisation. Through Moroccan history, it has hosted many people coming from East (Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Jews and Arabs), South (Sub-Saharan Africans) and North (Romans, Andalusians). All those civilisations have affected the social structure of Morocco. It hosts various forms of beliefs, from paganism, Judaism, and Christianity to Islam.</p>
	<p> Since independence, a veritable blossoming has taken place in painting and sculpture, popular music, amateur theatre, and filmmaking.[citation needed] The Moroccan National Theatre (founded 1956) offers regular productions of Moroccan and French dramatic works. Art and music festivals take place throughout the country during the summer months, among them the World Sacred Music Festival at Fès.</p>
	<p> Each region possesses its own specificities, thus contributing to the national culture and to the legacy of civilization. Morocco has set among its top priorities the protection of its diverse legacy and the preservation of its cultural heritage.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Culturally speaking, Morocco has always been successful in combining its Berber, Jewish and Arabic cultural heritage with external influences such as the French and the Spanish and, during the last decades, the Anglo-American lifestyles.[citation needed]</p>

	<p> The indigenous Berber people and a series of foreign invaders as well as religious and cultural influences have shaped Morocco's architectural styles. The architecture can range from ornate with bold with colours to simple, clean lines with earth tones.</p>
	<p> Influences from the Arab world, Spain, Portugal and France are seen in Moroccan architecture, both on their own and blended with Berber and Islamic styles. Among the buildings, and old Kasbah walls, sit French style-towns left behind by colonisation and intersect with intricately detailed mosques and riad-style homes. Sleek, modern designs are being constructed in cities like Rabat and Casablanca that give no particular homage to any of the past Moroccan architecture styles.[120]</p>
	<p> Literature</p>
	<p> Main article: Moroccan literature</p>
	<p> Leo Africanus.</p>
	<p> Moroccan literature is written in Arabic, Berber and French. Under the Almohad dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh, which accommodated no fewer than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book bazaar in history. The Almohad Caliph Abu Yakub had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the Casbah and turned into a public library.</p>
	<p> Modern Moroccan literature began in the 1930s. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of a modern literature. Morocco, as a French and Spanish protectorate left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely enjoying the contact of other Arabic literature and Europe. Three generations of writers especially shaped 20th century Moroccan literature.[121] The first was the generation that lived and wrote during the Protectorate (1912–56), its most important representative being Mohammed Ben Brahim (1897–1955).</p>
	<p> The second generation was the one that played an important role in the transition to independence with writers like Abdelkrim Ghallab (1919–2006), Allal al-Fassi (1910–1974) and Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi (1900–1963). The third generation is that of writers of the sixties. Moroccan literature then flourished with writers such as Mohamed Choukri, Driss Chraïbi, Mohamed Zafzaf and Driss El Khouri. Those writers were an important influence the many Moroccan novelists, poets and playwrights that were still to come.</p>
	<p> During the 1950s and 1960s, Morocco was a refuge and artistic centre and attracted writers as Paul Bowles, Tennessee Williams and William S. Burroughs. Moroccan literature flourished with novelists such as Mohamed Zafzaf and Mohamed Choukri, who wrote in Arabic, and Driss Chraïbi and Tahar Ben Jelloun who wrote in French. Other important Moroccan authors include, Abdellatif Laabi, Abdelkrim Ghallab, Fouad Laroui, Mohammed Berrada and Leila Abouzeid. It should be noted also, that orature (oral literature) is an integral part of Moroccan culture, be it in Moroccan Arabic or Amazigh.</p>
	<p> Music</p>
	<p> Main article: Music of Morocco</p>
	<p> Moroccan music is of Amazigh, Arab and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Muslim music.</p>
	<p> Morocco is home to Andalusian classical music that is found throughout North Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in Cordoba, and the Persian-born musician Ziryab is usually credited with its invention. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of Morisco visual artist/composer/oudist Tarik Banzi, founder of the Al-Andalus Ensemble.</p>
	<p> Chaabi ("popular") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.</p>
	<p> Aita is a Bedouin musical style sung in the countryside.</p>
	<p> Popular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as fusion, rock, country, metal and, in particular, hip hop.</p>
	<p> Morocco participated in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest, where it finished in the penultimate position.</p>
	<p> Cinema</p>
	<p> Main article: Cinema of Morocco</p>
	<p> Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain ("The Moroccan Goatherd") by Louis Lumière in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area.</p>
	<p> In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film regulatory body, was established. Studios were also opened in Rabat.</p>
	<p> In 1952, Orson Welles' Othello won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the Moroccan national anthem, as no one in attendance knew what it was.[122]</p>
	<p> Six years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan movie, Le fils maudit ("The Damned Son").</p>
	<p> In 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in Tangier. In its current incarnation, the event is held in Tetouan.</p>
	<p> This was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat.</p>
	<p> In 2001, the first International Film Festival of Marrakech (FIFM) was also held in Marrakech.</p>
	<p> Cuisine</p>
	<p> Main article: Moroccan cuisine</p>
	<p> Moroccan Couscous.</p>
	<p> Moroccan cuisine has long been considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world.[123] The cuisine of Morocco is mainly Berber-Moorish, European, Mediterranean cuisines. The cuisine of Morocco is essentially Berber cuisine (sometimes referred to as the Moorish cuisine). It is also Influenced by Sephardic cuisine and by the Moriscos when they took refuge in Morocco after the Spanish Reconquista.</p>
	<p> Spices are used extensively in Moroccan food. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients such as saffron from Tiliouine, mint and olives from Meknes, and oranges and lemons from Fez, are home-grown. Chicken is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is beef; lamb is preferred but is relatively expensive. The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is couscous,[124] the old national delicacy.</p>
	<p> Beef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a Tagine with vegetables or legumes. Chicken is also very commonly used in Tagines, knowing that one of the most famous tagine is the Tagine of Chicken, potatoes and olives. Lamb is also consumed, but as North African sheep breeds store most of their fat in their tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western lamb and mutton have. Poultry is also very common, and the use of seafood is increasing in Moroccan food. In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as kliia/khlia[125] and "g'did" which are used to flavor tagines or used in "el ghraif" a folded savory Moroccan pancake".</p>
	<p> Among the most famous Moroccan dishes are Couscous, Pastilla (also spelled Bsteeya or Bestilla), Tajine, Tanjia and Harira. Although the latter is a soup, it is considered as a dish in itself and is served as such or with dates especially during the month of Ramadan. Pork consumption is forbidden in accordance with Sharia, religious laws of Islam.</p>
	<p> A big part of the daily meal is bread. Bread in Morocco is principally from durum wheat semolina known as khobz. Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.</p>
	<p> The most popular drink is "atai", green tea with mint leaves and other ingredients. Tea occupies a very important place in the culture of Morocco and is considered an art form. It is served not only at mealtimes but all through the day, and it is especially a drink of hospitality, commonly served whenever there are guests. It is served to guests, and it is impolite to refuse it.</p>
	<p> Sport</p>
	<p> Main article: Sport in Morocco</p>
	<p> Moroccan football fans</p>
	<p> Football is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular. In 1986, Morocco became the first Arab and African country to qualify for the second round of the FIFA World Cup. Morocco was originally scheduled to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations,[126] but refused to host the tournament on the scheduled dates because of fears over the ebola outbreak on the continent.[127]</p>
	<p> At the 1984 Olympic Games, two Moroccans won gold medals in track and field. Nawal El Moutawakel won in the 400 metres hurdles; she was the first woman from an Arab or Islamic country to win an Olympic gold medal. Saïd Aouita won the 5000 metres at the same games. Hicham El Guerrouj won gold medals for Morocco at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the 1500 metres and 5000 metres and holds several world records in the mile run.</p>
	<p> Spectator sports in Morocco traditionally centered on the art of horsemanship until European sports—football, polo, swimming, and tennis—were introduced at the end of the 19th century. Tennis and golf have become popular.[citation needed] Several Moroccan professional players have competed in international competition, and the country fielded its first Davis Cup team in 1999. Rugby came to Morocco in the early 20th century, mainly by the French who occupied the country.[128] As a result, Moroccan rugby was tied to the fortunes of France, during the first and second World War, with many Moroccan players going away to fight.[128] Like many other Maghreb nations, Moroccan rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.</p>
	<p> Kickboxing is also popular in Morocco.[citation needed] The Dutch Badr Hari, heavyweight kickboxer and martial artist, is a former K-1 heavyweight champion and K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 and 2009 finalist.[citation needed]</p>

	eArt: `<p> Nation, a word used to describe a considerable number of people, who live on a specified portion of land enclosed within particular borders, and who obey the same government.</p>
	<p> Each nation has its own character: the genre of the proverb tells us so: carefree as a Frenchman, jealous as an Italian, serious as a Spaniard, wicked as an Englishman, proud as a Scotsman, drunk as a German, lazy as an Irishman, duplicitous as a Greek, etc.</p>
	<p> The word nation is also used in some universities to distinguish their agents or members, according to the diverse lands from which they come.</p>
	<p> The faculty of Paris consists of four nations ; known as, France, Picardy, Normandy, Germany: each of these nations, except for Normandy, is further divided into districts, and each district has its own priest, censor, legal representative, and its financiers, and gatekeepers or mafiosos.</p>
	<p> The German nation includes all the foreign nations , English, Italian, etc.</p>
	<p> The titles that they take in their assemblies, acts, and proclamations, etc. are for the nation of France, honoranda Gallorum natio ; for Picardy, fidelissima Picardorum natio ; one designates Normandy by veneranda Normanorum natio ; and Germany, by constantissima Germanorum natio. Each one has its own set of statutes for regulating the elections, honorariums, and hierarchies, in a word all that involves the police. They are officially ratified in parliament, and retain the force of law.</p>

	wArt: `<p> A nation (from Latin: natio, "people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them — including language, traditions, mores (customs), habitus (habits), and ethnicity. By comparison, a nation is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.[1]</p>
	<p> Ernest Renan's What is a Nation? (1882) declares that "race is confused with nation and a sovereignty analogous to that of really existing peoples is attributed to ethnographic or, rather linguistic groups", and "The truth is that there is no pure race and that to make politics depend upon ethnographic analysis is to surrender it to a chimera", echoing a sentiment of civic nationalism. He also claims that a nation is not formed on the basis of dynasty, language, religion, geography, or shared interests. Rather, "A nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Two things, which in truth are but one, constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is present-day consent, the desire to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received in an undivided form", emphasizing the democratic and historical aspects of what constitutes a nation, although, "Forgetting, I would even go so far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation". "A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity", which he famously said is reaffirmed in a "daily plebiscite".[2]</p>
	<p> The nation has been described by Benedict Anderson as an "imagined community"[3] and by Paul James as an "abstract community".[4] It is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections. It is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will never likely meet.[5] Hence the phrase, "a nation of strangers" used by such writers as Vance Packard.</p>
	<p> Etymology and terminology[edit]</p>
	<p> The word nation came to English from the Old French word nacion - meaning "birth" (naissance), "place of origin" -, which in turn originates from the Latin word natio (nātĭō) literally meaning "birth".[6]</p>
	<p> The word "nation" is sometimes used as synonym for:</p>
	<p> State (polity) or sovereign state: a government which controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group</p>
	<p> Country: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group</p>
	<p> Thus the phrase "nations of the world" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the United Nations), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.</p>
	<p> Depending on the meaning of "nation" used, the term "nation state" could be used to distinguish larger states from small city states, or could be used to distinguish multinational states from those with a single ethnic group.</p>
	<p> Ancient nations</p>
	<p> Although some scholars[7] of nationalism argue that nations are a modern phenomenon arising around the time of the French Revolution, other scholars assert that nations are an old, or even an ancient, type of political formation. Political scientist Azar Gat argues that ancient Egypt was the world's "first national state," emerging "quite early as a unified state, congruent with a distinct people of shared ethnicity."[8]</p>
	<p> Gat goes on to argue that the next group of national states to emerge were in the ancient Levant, citing Steven Grosby's book, Biblical Ideas of Nationality: Ancient and Modern, as an effective demonstration of the emergence of nations in Israel, Ammon, Moab, and Edom, a process of nation-formation provoked by the threat of conquest by the Assyrian Empire.[9] In particular, Gat cites Hans Kohn's The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in Its Origins and Background, 1944, pp. 27–30 as an early scholarly treatment of "the idea that ancient Israel was an example of a premodern nation."[10]</p>
	<p> In his book, The Athenian Nation Edward E. Cohen, argues that ancient Athens met all modern definitions of nationhood,[11] and Aviel Roshwald makes a similar argument in The Endurance of Nationalism: Ancient Roots and Modern Dilemmas.[12]</p>
	<p> Medieval nations[edit]</p>
	<p> In her book Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900-1300, Susan Reynolds argues that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class.[13] In his book The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism, Adrian Hastings argues that England's Anglo Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. Hastings argues that Alfred the Great, in particular, drew on biblical nationalism, using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into Old English to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, arguing that English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.[14]</p>
	<p> Another prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the Declaration of Arbroath, a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the Scottish Wars of Independence. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of Robert the Bruce and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the Battle of Bannockburn was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both Scottish nationalism and popular sovereignty.</p>
	<p> Anthony Kaldellis affirms in Hellenism in Byzantium (2008) that what is called the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire transformed into a nation-state in Middle Ages.</p>
	<p> Azar Gat is among the scholars who argue that China, Korea and Japan were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.[15]</p>
	<p> Use of term nationes by medieval universities and other medieval institutions[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Nation (university)</p>
	<p> A significant early use of the term nation, as natio, occurred at Medieval universities[16] to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the University of Paris, who were all born within a pays, spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, Jean Gerson was elected twice as a procurator for the French natio. The University of Prague adopted the division of students into nationes: from its opening in 1349 the studium generale which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian nations.</p>
	<p> In a similar way, the nationes were segregated by the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, who maintained at Rhodes the hostels from which they took their name "where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion", as the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur noted in 1436.[17]</p>
	<p> Early modern nations[edit]</p>
	<p> See also: Nation state</p>
	<p> In his article, "The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism", Philip S. Gorski argues that the first modern nation was the Dutch Republic, created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of biblical nationalism.[18] In a 2013 article "Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states", Diana Muir Appelbaum expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states.[19] A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by Anthony D. Smith in his books, Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity and Myths and Memories of the Nation.[20]</p>
	<p> In her book Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity, Liah Greenfeld argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was “the first nation in the world".[21][22]</p>
	<p> Social science[edit]</p>
	<p> In the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the civic nation of which France was the principal example and the ethnic nation exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and ethnic origins, that differentiate them from people of other nations.[23] On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the French Revolution and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to "live together", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.[24] This is the vision, among others, of Ernest Renan.[23]</p>
	<p> Present day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of national identity sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the State often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.[23]</p>
	<p> Black nationalism[edit]</p>
	<p> See also: African diaspora</p>
	<p> The 18th century brought an alteration to the meaning of the term "nation", which became more narrowly referred to as a group with a recognizable and sovereign government with physical borders. This new definition aligns more with the concept of a nation-state.[25] The nation began to emerge in the late 18th century as the leading form of government and social organization.[26] In the Americas, the catalyst that brought about this change in meaning was the influence of the African diaspora and its people in other states.[citation needed] National identity brought rights to vote, to hold office, and independence for a growing number of black territories held under colonial rule.[27]</p>
	<p> This change occurred in the New World as Africans were brought as enslaved peoples.[citation needed] The white population of the New World considered these aliens to be in one category of nation that was based entirely on color and continent of origin. The identity of the enslaved at the time was then shaped by their skin color rather than what nation or tribe they truly originated from. Prior to the 18th and 19th centuries, the term mainly referred to a group of people unified by language, region and cultural background; what is now considered to be one's ethnicity. It was through the process of emancipation and the end of the slave trade that the concept of nation began to change. As the previously enslaved began to fight for rights they had to discover what kind of rights they were searching for. It was in this process of emancipation that nationality began to take on a different meaning. Language and cultural background were no longer the only requirements of nation. Instead, now the idea of an established government and physical boundaries also shaped what it meant to be a nation.[28]</p>
	<p> However, within the diaspora, particularly among groups that have been politicized, the term nation has been used to describe a more abstract national experience, one that transcends physical borders and language differences. This description of nation is pinned to the shared experience of being radicalized and termed as Black. The expansion of Black nationalism demonstrates that although some expanded the view that nation requires definable boundaries, those who shared the experience of the diaspora also found a nationality among themselves.</p>
	<p> Nation of Islam[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Nation of Islam</p>
	<p> The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder Elijah Muhammad called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of Allah and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.</p>
	<p> Debate about a potential evolution or end of nations[edit]</p>
	<p> See also: Clash of Civilizations, City-state, Virtual community, Tribe (Internet), Global citizenship, Geographic mobility, Transnationalism, Geo-fence, Decentralization, Collective problem solving, and Sociocultural evolution</p>
	<p> There is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.[29]</p>
	<p> Postnationalism is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including economic globalization, a rise in importance of multinational corporations, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of socio-political power from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations and the European Union and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the Internet. However attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.[30][31][32]</p>
	<p> Transnational communities are social groups that emerge from mutual interaction and shared culture across national boundaries, oriented around a common project − such as the solving of a global issue − or 'imagined' identity.[33]</p>
	<p> Humans like being around people like themselves.[29] Other types of local communities − such as cities − might gain identity, influence and relevance as well as see increased sociocultural identification.</p>
	<p> Jan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that "the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one" with the latter being about "concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity" and neo-medievalism meaining "overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders".[29]</p>
	<p> In the view of Ian Goldin, head of the Oxford Martin School, which analyses global problems, such networks must emerge. He quotes Slaughter, saying "Networked problems require a networked response" and states that existing institutions such as the World Bank and UN agencies are structurally unable to deal with problems emerging from global interconnectivity, such as economic instability, pandemics, climate change and cybersecurity.[29]</p>
	<p> For a society to survive, its collective behaviour must be as complex as the challenges it faces and national agendas seem to repeatedly trump the global good in such vital matters.[29]</p>
	<p> As both city or regional administrations[29] and cooperation on the international level often prove to be more effective in solving critical issues than traditional models and as identities of transnational or nation-separate cultures develop the framework of nations might change, be extended or even be somewhat abolished.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Negro, man who inhabits different parts of the earth. From the tropic of Cancer to that of Capricorn, Africa has only black inhabitants. Not only their color distinguishes them, but they differ from other men in all the traits of their faces, with large flat noses, fat lips and wool instead of hair, and seem to constitute a new kind of men.</p>
	<p> If one moves away from the equator and towards the antarctic pole, the black lightens, but the ugliness remains: one finds that mean people that inhabits the southern tip of Africa.</p>
	<p> Returning up towards the Orient, one sees peoples whose traits soften and become more regular but whose color is as black as that found in Africa.</p>
	<p> Following these peoples, a great dark-skinned people distinguishes itself from the others by long narrow eyes, placed at a slant.</p>
	<p> If one passes into that vast part of the world which appears separated from Europe, Africa and Asia, one finds, as may be believed, a good many new varieties. There are no white men: this land, peopled by nations that are reddish and dark-skinned in a thousand shades, comes to an end towards the antarctic pole in a cape and islands inhabited, it is said, by giants. If we are to believe the accounts of several travelers, one finds at this end of America a race of men whose height is almost double our own.</p>
	<p> Before leaving our own continent, we could have spoken of another species of men very different from these. The inhabitants of the northern reaches of Europe are the smallest of all those known to us. The Lapps on the north side, the Patagonians on the south side appear to be at the extremes of the race of men.</p>
	<p> I would never finish if I spoke of the inhabitants of islands encountered in the Indian Ocean and of those that are in that vast ocean filling the space between Asia and America. Each people, each nation has its shape as well as its language. And is not shape a kind of language itself, and that among all others which makes itself best understood?</p>
	<p> If one traveled over all of these islands, one would find in some of them, perhaps, inhabitants far more embarrassing for us than the blacks, to whom we would have a good deal of difficulty in refusing or in giving the name of men . The inhabitants of the forests of Borneo of whom some travelers speak and who so resemble men in other respects, do they think the less for having monkey tails? And that which has been made to depend neither on whiteness nor blackness, should it depend on the number of vertebrae?</p>
	<p> On that isthmus which separates the North Sea from the Pacific Sea, it is said that one finds men whiter than all those of whom we know. Their hair might be taken for the whitest wool. Their eyes, too weak for the light of day, open only in the darkness of night. They are among mankind what bats and owls are among birds.</p>
	<p> The most remarkable phenomenon and the most constant law for the color of the inhabitants of the earth is that all that large band which circles the globe from east to west and which is called the torrid zone is inhabited only by peoples that are black or very swarthy. Despite the interruptions caused by the sea, if one follows the band across Africa, Asia and America, whether on islands or on continents, one finds only black nations, for the nocturnal men of whom we just spoke, and some whites who are occasionally born, don't merit any exceptions being made here.</p>
	<p> Moving away from the equator, the color of peoples lightens by shades. It is still quite dark beyond the Tropics, and one only finds it to be completely white when one advances into the temperate zone. It is in the extremities of this zone that one finds the whitest peoples. The Danish woman with blonde hair dazzles the astonished traveler; he can hardly believe that the object he sees and the African woman he has just seen are both women.</p>
	<p> Even farther towards the north and up to the frozen zone, in that land which the sun does not deign to light in winter, where an earth harder than the ploughshare offers none of the produce of other lands, in these dreadful climates, one finds complexions of lilies and roses. Rich countries of the south, lands of Peru and Potosi, make gold in your mines, I will not go to there to extract it. Golconda, sift the precious essence that forms diamonds and rubies, they will not make your women more beautiful and are useless to ours. Let them serve every year only to mark the weight and value of a foolish monarch who, while he is in these ridiculous scales, loses his states and his liberty.</p>
	<p> But in those extreme countries where all is white or all is black, is there not too great a uniformity and does not mixing produce new beauties? It is on the banks of the Seine that one finds that happy variety in the gardens of the Louvre; on a beautiful summer day, you will see everything in the way of marvels that the earth can produce.</p>
	<p> Did all these peoples that we have just run through, so many diverse men, come from a single mother? We are not permitted to doubt it.</p>
	<p> What remains for us to examine is how so many different species can have been born from a single individual. I will venture several conjectures.</p>
	<p> If men were all first formed from egg to egg, in the first mother there would have been eggs of different colors which contained innumerable series of eggs of the same species, but which would hatch in their order of development only after a certain number of generations, and in the period that providence had designated for the origination of the peoples contained in them. It is not impossible that one day, when the series of white eggs that peoples our regions runs out, all the European nations will change color or that Ethiopia will only have white inhabitants. It is thus that in a deep quarry, once the vein of white marble is exhausted, one finds only rocks of one color after another. It is in this way that new races of men may appear on the earth and that old ones may be extinguished.</p>
	<p> If we admit the theory of worms, if all men were at first contained in those animals that swam in the semen of the first man, one could say of these worms what was just said of eggs. The worm, father of negroes , contained from worm to worm all the inhabitants of Ethiopia. The Darien worm, the Hottentot worm and the Patagonian worm with all their descendants were all already formed and would one day people the parts of the earth where one finds these peoples. The Physical Venus .</p>
	<p> Other physicians have sought the cause of the blackness of negroes with much care; the principal conjectures that they have formed on this subject come down to two, of which one attributes the cause of blackness to bile and the other to the humor enclosed in the vessels with which the mucous membrane is filled. See Mucous membrane.</p>
	<p> Malpighi, Ruisch, Litre, Sanctorini, Heister and Albinus have conducted interesting research on the skin of negroes .</p>
	<p> The first belief about the blackness of negroes is supported in all its proofs in a work entitled, Dissertation on the physical case of the color of negroes , etc. by M. Barrere. Paris 1741, in ‹-› 12 . This is how he deduces his hypothesis.</p>
	<p> If, after a long soaking of the skin of a negro in water, one detaches the epidermis or outer skin and examines it attentively, one finds it to be black, very thin, and it appears transparent when one holds it up to the light. This is how I saw it in America and what one of the most knowledgeable anatomists of our day, Mr. Winslou, has also observed... On dissection, one finds leather, properly speaking, or the skin with all the apparatus, like the cutaneous nipples and the blackish red reticulate membrane. It is thus obviously proven that the color of negroes is not, so to say, a borrowed color, and consequently the apparent color of the epidermis is not that of the mucous membrane in and of itself, according to the language of some, or of the reticulate substance, as has been thought up until now, it is thus from its own tissue that the epidermis or outer skin in negroes directly derives blackness. Let us say moreover that, since the epidermis of negroes is naturally of a transparent black, its color must become even darker from the skin that is placed beneath it, which is of an almost black reddish brown. But the epidermis of moors, as well as that of whites, since they are a tissue of vessels, must necessarily enclose a juice, the examination of which belongs to the present question. One can say with some foundation that this juice is analogous to bile and observation seems to support this belief; 1. In the cadavers of negroes I had the opportunity to dissect in Cayenne, I observed that the bile was always black as ink; 2. that it was the more or the less black according to the color of the negroes ; 3. that their blood was of a blackish red, according to the greater or lesser blackness of the negroes ' complexion; 4. it is certain that bile enters with the chyle in the blood, that it flows with it into all the parts of the body, that it passes into the liver, and that several of its parts escape through the kidneys and the other parts of the body. Why then can it not also be that this same bile in negroes becomes separated in the tissue of the epidermis? And yet experience proves that bile in fact becomes separated in the epidermis of negroes in the individual vessels, since, if we apply the end of the finger to the surface of a negro 's skin, a humor that is fatty, viscous, almost soapy, and of a disagreeable odor sticks onto it, this doubtless gives that shine and softness that one observes in the skin. If one rubs this same outer skin with a white cloth, it dirties the cloth with a brown color, all qualities related to the bile of negroes .... We may judge that bile is naturally abundant in the blood of negroes from the strength and rapidity of the pulse, from the extreme delicacy of the other spirited passions, and above all from the considerable heat of the skin that is observed in them. Experience shows us as well that the heat of blood is proper to forming a lot of bile, since we see a yellowing of the milk among white women when a wet-nurse has a fever. Finally, can we not view the color of negroes in some way as a natural black icterus?</p>
	<p> 1. From what we have just said, we see that the humor forming the color of negroes seems to be the same as bile: perhaps that which filters into the liver differs from it only by degree; 2. that it is more than probable that bile is separated not only in the liver of negroes , but also in almost imperceptible vessels in the epidermis, where, freed from the red parts of the blood, it doubtless must return to its original form and, consequently show itself in its natural blackness; 3. that the coarse parts of this bile, from their stay in the tissue of the epidermis, must give them a black color; whereas, on the individual discharge of blood, the faintest parts of the bile are exhaled outside through skin pores like a kind of vapor, which is not at all black and almost without bitterness, that accumulates insensibly on the epidermis, thickens there, and spreads a disagreeable odor. A completely similar thing occurs when, after having lightly heated the bile of a negro in a little container covered with parchment and pierced with several little holes, one observes the sides of the container to be tinted black and when, over time one sees issue from the little holes in the cover a kind of steam that condenses (if the cover is connected to a cone-shaped goblet) into detectable droplets which in no way have the color or taste of bile.</p>
	<p> Such are the principal proofs on which M. Barrere relies to situate the principal for the color of negroes in bile. One might be well-pleased to discover here the problems to which this belief is exposed. They follow from the following observations: 1. the bodies of negroes who have died in water take on, it is said, a white color; they can be distinguished from whites only by their hair; 2. small pox is white in negroes and this whiteness has frequently fooled doctors; 3. negroes vomit a yellow bile, this is a firm fact; 4. Negroes are subject to jaundice and the conjunctiva becomes yellow as well as the internal parts; 5. the blackish bile that one finds in the vesicles of white men almost always appear to be yellow as soon as it is diluted; 6. when the bile of white men is distilled, it goes through different colors and finally leaves a black essence which gives a blackish color to the vessels containing it; the bile of negroes may thus appear blackish, when it has accumulated and it may be yellow when it is diluted; or the blackness of this bile, in the cadavers of negroes , may have taken on this color in illness or through various accidents; 7. the entrails of negroes and their skin have the same color that they have in men who are white; 8. finally, there are illnesses that blacken bile without any trace of this being left in the body. In men who die from rabies, the bile is found to be entirely black while the surface of the skin is perfectly white. From all of these facts, it may be concluded that it is impossible to attribute the color of negroes to bile. This liquid is yellow in negroes ; it does not give any tint to exterior parts in the natural state. It yellows the eyes as soon as it spreads through the body. It would tint black the internal parts of the body if it were truly black and if it were carried to these parts. Add to this that urine would take on the same tint as that which fills the vessels of the mucous membrane.</p>
	<p> The vessels of the mucous membrane : according to the observations of Malpighy , the skin and the cuticle of negroes are white. The blackness comes only from the mucous membrane or from the reticulate membrane which is between the epidermis and the skin. The injections of Ruisch have partially confirmed this discovery and thrown greater light on it. The outer skin is not white in negroes , according to this anatomist; it only has whiteness from callus which always is mixed with black. Ruisch sent to Heister a portion of the skin of a negro . It was perfectly white, but the external surface of the epidermis was blackish and the internal side was covered with a dark, black tint. Sanctorini, in his Anatomical Remarks , has given us observations that situate the cause of the color of negroes in the mucous membrane. This research proves that, once one removes the epidermis, remaining on the skin or the vascular tissue is a portion of the mucous membrane that is extremely black; that it imparts its tint to the fingers to which it frequently attaches itself when one removes the epidermis; and that consequently there is a separate reservoir of this tint between the epidermis and the skin. The mucous membrane, an almost unknown tissue, appears to be very uneven in different parts of the body. It is tightly attached to the epidermis; it would be impossible to separate it off completely. It is for this reason that the blackish color cannot be erased in the outer skin and that it is darker in the internal surface of this integument. The vessels of the reticulate membrane are full of a blackish liquid. One may ask where this forms. Sanctorini did not think it possible to decide what was the source of this material that tints the reticular membrane of negroes ; but he suspected that the liver might provide the tint of the skin in this species of men. The red color of a fish's liver, various sorts of icteruses to which men are subject and the blackness that one sometimes finds in the bile of the spleen, brought him to this conjecture. Moreover, the sources of a black liquid can be found in several parts of the body, in the fetus, in glands between the bronchial tubes which produce a black liquid, in black glands found in the eyes of animals from which doubtless results the juice that blackens the choroid. Thus, black juices may pass into various parts of the body: there are even fluids that, in losing their natural color, go through various gradations. Bile becomes blackish in the gall bladder. Urine itself acquires this color in certain illnesses. From the two opinions that I have outlined in this note and the preceding one, it appears to me to follow that the physical problem is still largely undecided.</p>
	<p> Why do negroes have frizzy hair? Let us listen once again to M. Barrere 's opinion on these questions. It is already acknowledged in the scholarly world, and it is the generally accepted opinion, that in the germ of the bodies of animals may be found, as if in concentration, all the parts that compose them with their color and their shape determined; that these parts develop, grow and blossom as soon as they are put into play and penetrated by a very fine and spirituous fluid, that is the male semen; that this seminal liquid imprints its character on this point of matter that concentrates all of its parts in their germ. Following these principles, which seem very true, one may consider: 1. that, since the germ of the bodies of animals in development comes from the male and the female, it must receive the traits of the one and the other; 2. that it seems very likely that the germ contained in the womb of the female naturally contains all the traits of resemblance and that it receives the resemblance of the male only from the intrusion of the seminal liquid which determines the parts of the germ that will acquire movement; 3. that the movement which happens to the parts of the germ in animals of the same species must almost always be uniform, and, as seemingly of the same degree, but nonetheless lesser than that which occurs during the coupling of animals of different species; it must even be that in such a coupling the movement is violent and seemingly forced, to the effect that the fluids must leave the path of their natural direction and lose their way, so to speak. One may judge this to be so from the considerable disorder that happens to the originary parts of the germ; 4. that the production of monsters is one of the most convincing proofs of such a surprising disorder; 5. It follows, as well, that a negress who may have had commerce with a white or European, for example, must produce a mulatto who must look different from a negro because of the new modification in the color of its skin and in its hair which this child has received in the womb of its mother; 6. that this new modification in the mulatto necessarily depends on the existence of a humor that passes through the less black epidermis and on a dilation of the insensitive vessels of a less curly hair. Also, one sees every day in America not only mulattos, but also in the different mixes of blood, skin color which becomes lighter or darker and hair that is straighter and longer according to the gradation of the distance from the natural complexion of negroes ; 7. that finally one must conclude that the cause of the degeneration of the color of negroes and of the quality of their hair must in all likelihood be related to the action of and to the greater or lesser incompatibility of the seminal fluid with the germ that penetrates in the first moments of the evolution of the parts.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Negro (plural Negroes) is a term traditionally used to denote persons considered to be of Negroid heritage. It has various equivalents in other languages.</p>
	<p> In English</p>
	<p> A European map of West Africa, 1736. Included is the archaic mapping designation of Negroland.</p>
	<p> Around 1442, the Portuguese first arrived in Southern Africa while trying to find a sea route to India.[citation needed] The term negro, literally meaning 'black', was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description to refer to the Bantu peoples that they encountered. Negro denotes "black" in Spanish and Portuguese, derived from the Latin word niger, meaning black, which itself is probably from a Proto-Indo-European root *nekw-, "to be dark", akin to *nokw-, night.[1][2] "Negro" was also used of the peoples of West Africa in old maps labelled Negroland, an area stretching along the Niger River.</p>
	<p> From the 18th century to the late 1960s, negro (later capitalized) was considered to be the proper English-language term for people of black African origin. According to Oxford Dictionaries, use of the word "now seems out of date or even offensive in both British and US English".[3]</p>
	<p> A specifically female form of the word, negress (sometimes capitalized), was occasionally used. However, like Jewess, it has all but completely fallen from use.</p>
	<p> Negroid has traditionally been used within physical anthropology to denote one of the three purported races of humankind, alongside Caucasoid and Mongoloid. The suffix -oid means "similar to". "Negroid" as a noun was used to designate a wider or more generalized category than Negro; as an adjective, it qualified a noun as in, for example, "negroid features".[4]</p>
	<p> United States</p>
	<p> "Negro" was once an acceptable term. All-Negro Comics was a 1947 comic anthology written by African-American writers and featuring black characters.</p>
	<p> An emblem of the US Negro league baseball.</p>
	<p> Negro superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive.[5] In Colonial America during the 1600s the term Negro was, according to one historian, also used to describe Native Americans[6] The American Negro Academy was founded in 1897, to support liberal arts education. Marcus Garvey used the word in the names of black nationalist and pan-Africanist organizations such as the Universal Negro Improvement Association (founded 1914), the Negro World (1918), the Negro Factories Corporation (1919), and the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World (1920). W. E. B. Du Bois and Dr. Carter G. Woodson used it in the titles of their non-fiction books, The Negro (1915) and The Mis-Education of the Negro (1933) respectively. "Negro" was accepted as normal, both as exonym and endonym, until the late 1960s, after the later Civil Rights Movement. One well-known example is the identification by Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as "Negro" in his famous "I Have a Dream" speech of 1963.</p>
	<p> However, during the 1950s and 1960s, some black American leaders, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second class citizens, or worse.[7] Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro, but also started using the term Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam.[8]</p>
	<p> Since the late 1960s, various other terms have been more widespread in popular usage. These include black, Black African, Afro-American (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and African American.[9] The word Negro fell out of favor by the early 1970s. However, many older African Americans initially found the term black more offensive than Negro.</p>
	<p> The term Negro is still used in some historical contexts, such as the songs known as Negro spirituals, the Negro Leagues of sports in the early and mid-20th century, and organizations such as the United Negro College Fund.[10][11] The academic journal published by Howard University since 1932 still bears the title Journal of Negro Education, but others have changed: e.g. the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (founded 1915) became the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History in 1973, and is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History; its publication The Journal of Negro History became The Journal of African American History in 2001. Margo Jefferson titled her 2015 book Negroland: A Memoir to evoke growing up in the 1950s and 1960s in the African-American upper class.</p>
	<p> The United States Census Bureau included Negro on the 2010 Census, alongside Black and African-American, because some older black Americans still self-identify with the term.[12][13][14] The U.S. Census now uses the grouping "Black, African-American, or Negro." Negro is used in efforts to include older African Americans who more closely associate with the term.[15]</p>
	<p> Liberia</p>
	<p> The constitution of Liberia limits Liberian nationality to Negro people (see also Liberian nationality law).[16] People of other racial origins, even if they have lived for many years in Liberia, are thus precluded from becoming citizens of the Republic.[17]</p>
	<p> In other languages</p>
	<p> Latin America (Portuguese and Spanish)</p>
	<p> In Spanish, negro (feminine negra) is most commonly used for the color black, but it can also be used to describe people with dark-colored skin. In Spain, Mexico and almost all of Latin America, negro (lower-cased, as ethnonyms are generally not capitalized in Romance languages) means 'black person'. As in English, this Spanish word is often used figuratively and negatively, to mean 'irregular' or 'undesirable', as in mercado negro ('black market'). However, in Spanish-speaking countries where there are fewer people of West African slave origin, such as Argentina and Uruguay, negro and negra are commonly used to refer to partners, close friends[18] or people in general, independent of skin color. In Venezuela the word negro is similarly used, despite its large West African slave-descended population percentage.</p>
	<p> In certain parts of Latin America, the usage of negro to directly address black people can be colloquial. It is important to understand that this is not similar to the use of the word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that "negro" is not a racist term. For example, one might say to a friend, "Negro ¿Como andas? (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive negrito can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. Negrito has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. (However, in the Philippines negrito was used for a local dark-skinned, short population native to the Negros islands among other places; this is the meaning of Negrito in English.) In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word negro can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States.</p>
	<p> In Portuguese, negro is an adjective for the color black, although preto is the most common antonym of branco ('white'). In Brazil and Portugal, negro is equivalent to preto, but it is far less commonly used. In Portuguese-speaking Brazil, usage of "negro" heavily depends on the region. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, where the main racial slur against black people is crioulo (literally 'creole', i.e. Americas-born person of West African slave descent), preto/preta and pretinho/pretinha can in very informal situations be used with the same sense of endearment as negro/negra and negrito/negrita in Spanish-speaking South America, but its usage changes in the nearby state of São Paulo, where crioulo is considered an archaism and preto is the most-used equivalent of "negro"; thus any use of preto/a carries the risk of being deemed offensive.</p>
	<p> Other Romance languages</p>
	<p> In Italian, negro (male) and negra (female) were used as neutral term equivalents of "negro" until the end of the 1960s. Either word is now considered offensive; if used with a clear offensive intention it may be punished by law.</p>
	<p> In the French language, the positive concept of negritude ('blackness') was developed by the Senegalese politician Léopold Sédar Senghor. The word nègre as a racial term fell out of favor around the same time as its English equivalent negro. Its usage in French today has shifted completely, to refer to a ghostwriter (i.e. one who writes a book on behalf of its nominal author, usually a non-literary celebrity).</p>
	<p> In Haitian Creole, the word nèg (derived from the French nègre referring to a dark-skinned man), can also be used for any man, regardless of skin color, roughly like guy or dude in American English.</p>
	<p> Scandinavian languages</p>
	<p> In Swedish and Norwegian, neger used to be considered a neutral equivalent to "negro". However, the term gradually fell out of favour through the late-1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s.</p>
	<p> In Denmark, usage of neger is up for debate. Linguists and others may argue that the word has a historical racist legacy that makes it unsuitable for use today. Mainly older people use the word neger with the notion that it is a neutral word paralleling "negro". Relatively few young people use it, other than for provocative purposes in recognition that the word's acceptability has declined.[19]</p>
	<p> In the Finnish language the word neekeri (cognate with negro) was long considered a neutral equivalent for "negro".[20] In 2002, neekeri's usage notes in the Kielitoimiston sanakirja shifted from "perceived as derogatory by some" to "generally derogatory".[20] The name of a popular Finnish brand of chocolate-coated marshmallow treats was changed by the manufacturers from Neekerinsuukko (lit. 'negro's kiss', like the German version) to Brunbergin suukko ('Brunberg's kiss') in 2001.[20] A study conducted among native Finns found that 90% of research subjects considered the terms neekeri and ryssä among the most derogatory epithets for ethnic minorities.[21]</p>
	<p> Germanic languages</p>
	<p> The Dutch word, neger is generally (but not universally) considered to be a neutral one, or at least less negative than zwarte ('black').[22]</p>
	<p> In German, Neger was considered to be a neutral term for black people, but gradually fell out of fashion since the 1970s. Neger is now mostly thought to be derogatory or racist.</p>
	<p> Elsewhere</p>
	<p> In Turkish, zenci is the closest equivalent to "negro". The appellation was derived from the Arabic zanj for Bantu peoples. It is usually used without any negative connotation.</p>
	<p> In Hungarian, néger (possibly derived from its German equivalent) is still considered to be the most neutral equivalent of "negro".[23]</p>
	<p> In Russia, the term негр (negr) was commonly used in the Soviet period without any negative connotation, and its use continues in this neutral sense. In modern Russian media, the negr is used somewhat less frequently. Čërnyj as an adjective is also used in a neutral sense, and conveys the same meaning as negr, as in чёрные американцы (čërnye amerikancy or chyornuye amerikantsy: 'black Americans'). Other alternatives to negr are темнокожий (temnokozhiy—dark-skinned), чернокожий (chernokozhiy: black-skinned). These two are used as both nouns and adjectives. See also Afro-Russian.</p>`

	eArt: `Nobility. One might consider nobility , as does Chancellor Bacon, in two different ways, either as constituting part of a state, or as constituting the condition of individuals.</p>
	<p> As part of a state, all monarchy that does not possess nobility is pure tyranny: nobility enters in some manner into the essence of monarchy, the fundamental maxim of which is, no nobility, no monarch; but one has a despot, as in Turkey.
	<p> Nobility tempers sovereignty, and by its own splendor accustoms the people to fix their eyes on and withstand the brilliance of royalty without being afraid. A great and powerful nobility adds to a prince's splendor, although it diminishes his power when it is itself too powerful. It is good for the prince and for justice that nobility not be too strong, and that it conserve at the same time enough estimable grandeur to repress popular insolence and to prevent it from attacking the majesty of the throne. In a monarchical state, the most natural subordinate intermediary power, is that of the nobility; abolish its prerogatives, and you will soon have a popular state, or a despotic state.</p>
	<p> Honor governs nobility , by prescribing to it obedience to the will of the prince; but this honor dictates at the same time that the prince never command it to commit a dishonorable act. Nothing is prescribed more strongly to the nobility than serving the prince during wartime: that is the distinguished profession fitting to the nobility , for its hazards, its successes and even its misfortunes lead to greatness.</p>
	<p> It is thus necessary that in a monarchy laws work to support the nobility and to make it hereditary, not in order to be the line between the prince and the people, but to be the link between the two. The prerogatives accorded to nobility will belong to it alone under a monarchy, and will not pass to the people, if one does not wish to violate the principle of government, if one does not wish to diminish the power of the nobility and that of the people. However a too-numerous nobility ordinarily weakens a monarchical state; for in addition to being overly costly, it happens that most of the nobles will become poor over time, creating a kind of disproportion between honors and means.</p>
	<p> The nobles in an aristocracy tend to enjoy limitless authority; that is why if nobles exist in great number, one needs a senate to regulate those affairs that the body of nobles is unable to decide, and to prepare those that it will decide. It is as easy for a body of nobles to control other aristocrats as it is difficult for this body to curb its own self: such is the nature of this constitution, that it seems to place the same people under the governance of laws and then to remove them. Now such a body can restrict itself only in two ways, either by great virtue, which makes the nobles in a sense equal to their people, and may result in a sort of republic; or by a lesser virtue, that is a certain moderation that renders nobles at least equal to themselves, that preserves them.</p>
	<p> Both the extreme poverty of nobles and their exorbitant wealth are pernicious to aristocracy. To prevent their poverty, one must above all require them early on to pay their debts. To moderate their wealth requires wise and painless regulations, not confiscations, nor agrarian laws, nor abolition of debt, which create infinite evils.</p>
	<p> In an aristocracy, the law must remove primogeniture from among nobles , as established in Venice, so that by the continual division of inheritances, fortunes may always remain equal. There must be consequently no substitutions, no replacements, no transmissions, no adoptions: in a word, all the methods invented to support the nobility in monarchical states, tend to establish tyranny within the aristocracy.</p>
	<p> When laws have equalized families, they will still need to maintain union among them. Disputes among nobles must be promptly settled, or altercations between individuals become altercations between families. Arbiters could put an end to trials or prevent them from developing.</p>
	<p> Finally laws must not favor the distinctions that vanity places between families, on the vain pretext that they are more noble and older; that should left to the pettiness of individuals.</p>
	<p> Democracies have no need for nobility , they are even more peaceful when there are no noble families; for then one considers the thing proposed and not the individual proposing it; or when it happens that the individual is taken into account, it is only to the extent that he might be useful to the business at hand, and not because of his coat of arms and genealogy. The Swiss republic, for example, maintains itself very well despite the diversity of its religions and cantons, because utility and not respect hold it together. The government of the United Provinces possesses the advantage that equality among persons produces equality in the counsels, and thus taxes and contributions are paid with a better will.</p>
	<p> With regard to the nobility of individuals, one has a sort of respect for an old castle or for a building that has stood the test of time, or even for a tall and beautiful tree that is fresh and whole in spite of its age. How much more respect should one have for a noble and ancient family that has sustained itself despite the ravages of time? New nobility is the work of princely power, but ancient nobility is the work of time alone: the first inspires more talent, the second more transcendent grandeur.</p>
	<p> Those who are first raised to nobility ordinarily have more genius but less innocence than their descendants. The route to honor is crossed by torturous paths that one often follows rather than taking the straight road.</p>
	<p> Noble birth commonly stifles industry and emulation. Nobles do not have as far to go as do others in order to reach the highest levels; and he who is stopped while others rise ordinarily experiences feelings of envy. But since the nobility alone possesses the right to receive honors, this possession stifles the envy that would be felt if these honors were newly bestowed. Kings able to choose prudent and capable individuals from among their nobility find that doing so advantageously facilitates the task: the people obey them naturally, as men who are born to command. See Birth.</p>`,
	wArt:`Nobility is a social class, normally ranked immediately under royalty, that possesses more acknowledged privileges and higher social status than most other classes in a society, membership thereof typically being hereditary. The privileges associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles, or may be largely honorary (e.g., precedence), and vary from country to country and era to era.
	<p> Historically, membership in the nobility and the prerogatives thereof have been regulated or acknowledged by the monarch or government, thereby distinguishing it from other sectors of a nation's upper class wherein wealth, lifestyle or affiliation may be the salient markers of membership. Nonetheless, nobility per se has rarely constituted a closed caste; acquisition of sufficient power, wealth, military prowess or royal favour has, with varying frequency, enabled commoners to ascend into the nobility.</p>
	<p> There is often a variety of ranks within the noble class. Legal recognition of nobility has been more common in monarchies, but nobility also existed in such regimes as the Dutch Republic (1581–1795), the Republic of Genoa (1005–1815) and the Republic of Venice (697–1797), and remains part of the legal social structure of some non-hereditary regimes, e.g., San Marino and the Vatican City in Europe. Hereditary titles often distinguish nobles from non-nobles, although in many nations most of the nobility have been un-titled, and a hereditary title need not ipso facto indicate nobility (e.g., vidame). Some countries have had non-hereditary nobility, such as the Empire of Brazil.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<p> The term derives from Latin nobilitas, the abstract noun of the adjective nobilis ("well-known, famous, notable"). In ancient Roman society, nobiles originated as an informal designation for the political governing class who had allied interests, including both patricians and plebeian families (gentes) with an ancestor who had risen to the consulship through his own merit (see novus homo, "new man").</p>
	<p> In modern usage, "nobility" is applied to the highest social class in pre-modern societies, excepting the ruling dynasty. In the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often land or office, under vassalage, i.e., in exchange for allegiance and various, mainly military, services to a suzerain, who might be a higher-ranking nobleman or a monarch. It rapidly came to be seen as a hereditary caste, sometimes associated with a right to bear a hereditary title and, for example in pre-revolutionary France, enjoying fiscal and other privileges.</p>
	<p> While noble status formerly conferred significant privileges in most jurisdictions, by the 21st century it had become a largely honorary dignity in most societies, although a few, residual privileges may still be preserved legally (e.g., Netherlands, Spain, UK) and some Asian, Pacific and African cultures continue to attach considerable significance to formal hereditary rank or titles. (Compare the entrenched position and leadership expectations of the nobility of the Kingdom of Tonga.)</p>
	<p> Nobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, differing from high socio-economic status in that the latter is mainly based on income, possessions and/or lifestyle. Being wealthy or influential cannot, ipso facto, make one noble, nor are all nobles wealthy or influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself).</p>
	<p> Various republics, including former Iron Curtain countries, Greece, Mexico, and Austria have expressly abolished the conferral and use of titles of nobility for their citizens. This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use as part of the legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid attachment of any privilege thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union, while French law also protects lawful titles against usurpation.</p>
	<p> Although many societies have a privileged upper class with substantial wealth and power, the status is not necessarily hereditary and does not entail a distinct legal status, nor differentiated forms of address.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Noble privileges</h4>
	<p> A French political cartoon of the three orders of feudal society (1789). The rural third estate carries the clergy and the nobility.</p>
	<p> Not all of the benefits of nobility derived from noble status per se. Usually privileges were granted or recognised by the monarch in association with possession of a specific title, office or estate. Most nobles' wealth derived from one or more estates, large or small, that might include fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting grounds, streams, etc. It also included infrastructure such as castle, well and mill to which local peasants were allowed some access, although often at a price. Nobles were expected to live "nobly", that is, from the proceeds of these possessions. Work involving manual labour or subordination to those of lower rank (with specific exceptions, such as in military or ecclesiastic service) was either forbidden (as derogation from noble status) or frowned upon socially. On the other hand, membership in the nobility was usually a prerequisite for holding offices of trust in the realm and for career promotion, especially in the military, at court and often the higher functions in the government, judiciary and church.</p>
	<p> Prior to the French Revolution, European nobles typically commanded tribute in the form of entitlement to cash rents or usage taxes, labour and/or a portion of the annual crop yield from commoners or nobles of lower rank who lived or worked on the noble's manor or within his seigneurial domain. In some countries, the local lord could impose restrictions on such a commoner's movements, religion or legal undertakings. Nobles exclusively enjoyed the privilege of hunting. In France, nobles were exempt from paying the taille, the major direct tax. Peasants were not only bound to the nobility by dues and services, but the exercise of their rights was often also subject to the jurisdiction of courts and police from whose authority the actions of nobles were entirely or partially exempt. In some parts of Europe the right of private war long remained the privilege of every noble.</p>
	<p> During the early Renaissance, duelling established the status of a respectable gentleman, and was an accepted manner of resolving disputes. According to Ariel Roth, during the reign of Henry IV, over 4,000 French aristocrats were killed in duels "in an eighteen-year period" whilst a twenty-year period of Louis XIII's reign saw some eight thousand pardons for "murders associated with duels".</p>
	<p> Since the end of World War I the hereditary nobility entitled to special rights has largely been abolished in the Western World as intrinsically discriminatory, and discredited as inferior in efficiency to individual meritocracy in the allocation of societal resources. Nobility came to be associated with social rather than legal privilege, expressed in a general expectation of deference from those of lower rank. By the 21st century even that deference had become increasingly minimised.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Ennoblement</h4>
	<p> In France, a seigneurie (lordship) might include one or more manors surrounded by land and villages subject to a noble's prerogatives and disposition. Seigneuries could be bought, sold or mortgaged. If erected by the crown into, e.g., a barony or countship, it became legally entailed for a specific family, which could use it as their title. Yet most French nobles were untitled ("seigneur of Montagne" simply meant ownership of that lordship but not, if one was not otherwise noble, the right to use a title of nobility, as commoners often purchased lordships). Only a member of the nobility who owned a countship was allowed, ipso facto, to style himself as its comte, although this restriction came to be increasingly ignored as the ancien régime drew to its close.</p>
	<p> In other parts of Europe, sovereign rulers arrogated to themselves the exclusive prerogative to act as fons honorum within their realms. For example, in the United Kingdom royal letters patent are necessary to obtain a title of the peerage, which also carries nobility and formerly a seat in the House of Lords, but never came with automatic entail of land nor rights to the local peasants' output.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Rank within the nobility</h4>
	<p> Nobility might be either inherited or conferred by a fons honorum. It is usually an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary, i.e. the status descends exclusively to some or all of the legitimate, and usually male-line, descendants of a nobleman. In this respect, the nobility as a class has always been much more extensive than the primogeniture-based titled nobility, which included peerages in France and in the United Kingdom, grandezas in Portugal and Spain, and some noble titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Scandinavia. In Russia, Scandinavia and non-Prussian Germany, titles usually descended to all male-line descendants of the original titleholder, including females. In Spain, noble titles are now equally heritable by females and males. Noble estates, on the other hand, gradually came to descend by primogeniture in much of western Europe aside from Germany. In Eastern Europe, by contrast, with the exception of a few Hungarian estates, they usually descended to all sons or even all children</p>
	<p> In France, some wealthy bourgeois, most particularly the members of the various parlements, were ennobled by the king, constituting the noblesse de robe. The old nobility of landed or knightly origin, the noblesse d'épée, increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this parvenu nobility. In the last years of the ancien régime the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and orders of chivalry to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended "quarterings", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favors at court along with nobles of medieval descent, although historians such as William Doyle have disputed this so-called "Aristocratic Reaction". Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could "prove" an ancestry of at least seize quartiers (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's coat of arms) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents).</p>

	<p> This illustrates the traditional link in many countries between heraldry and nobility; in those countries where heraldry is used, nobles have almost always been armigerous, and have used heraldry to demonstrate their ancestry and family history. However, heraldry has never been restricted to the noble classes in most countries, and being armigerous does not necessarily demonstrate nobility. Scotland, however, is an exception. In a number of recent cases in Scotland the Lord Lyon King of Arms has controversially (vis-à-vis Scotland's Salic law) granted the arms and allocated the chiefships of medieval noble families to female-line descendants of lords, even when they were not of noble lineage in the male line, while persons of legitimate male-line descent may still survive (e.g. the modern Chiefs of Clan MacLeod).</p>
	<p> In some nations, hereditary titles, as distinct from noble rank, were not always recognised in law, e.g., Poland's Szlachta. European ranks of nobility lower than baron or its equivalent, are commonly referred to as the petty nobility, although baronets of the British Isles are deemed titled gentry. Most nations traditionally had an untitled lower nobility in addition to titled nobles. An example is the landed gentry of the British Isles. Unlike England's gentry, the Junkers of Germany, the noblesse de robe of France, the hidalgos of Spain and the nobili of Italy were explicitly acknowledged by the monarchs of those countries as members of the nobility, although untitled. In Scandinavia, the Benelux nations and Spain there are still untitled as well as titled families recognised in law as noble.</p>
	<p> In Hungary members of the nobility always theoretically enjoyed the same rights. In practice, however, a noble family's financial assets largely defined its significance. Medieval Hungary's concept of nobility originated in the notion that nobles were "free men", eligible to own land. This basic standard explains why the noble population was relatively large, although the economic status of its members varied widely. Untitled nobles were not infrequently wealthier than titled families, while considerable differences in wealth were also to be found within the titled nobility. The custom of granting titles was introduced to Hungary in the 16th century by the House of Habsburg. Historically, once nobility was granted, if a nobleman served the monarch well he might obtain the title of baron, and might later be elevated to the rank of count. As in other countries of post-medieval central Europe, hereditary titles were not attached to a particular land or estate but to the noble family itself, so that all patrilineal descendants shared a title of baron or count (cf. peerage). Neither nobility nor titles could be transmitted through women.</p>
	<p> Some con artists sell fake titles of nobility, often with impressive-looking documentation. This may be illegal, depending on local law. They are more often illegal in countries that actually have nobilities, such as European monarchies. In the United States, such commerce may constitute actionable fraud rather than criminal usurpation of an exclusive right to use of any given title by an established class.</p>

	<h4> Other terms</h4>
	<p> "Aristocrat" and aristocracy, in modern usage, refer colloquially and broadly to persons who inherit elevated social status, whether due to membership in the (formerly) official nobility or the monied upper class.</p>
	<p> Blue blood is an English idiom recorded since 1834 for noble birth or descent; it is also known as a translation of the Spanish phrase sangre azul, which described the Spanish royal family and other high nobility who claimed to be of Visigothic descent, in contrast to the Moors. The idiom originates from ancient and medieval societies of Europe and distinguishes an upper class (whose superficial veins appeared blue through their untanned skin) from a working class of the time. The latter consisted mainly of agricultural peasants who spent most of their time working outdoors and thus had tanned skin, through which superficial veins appear less prominently.</p>
	<p> Robert Lacey explains the genesis of the blue blood concept:</p>
	<p> It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Europe</h4>
	<p> European nobility originated in the feudal/seignorial system that arose in Europe during the Middle Ages. Originally, knights or nobles were mounted warriors who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land (usually together with serfs living thereon). During the period known as the Military Revolution, nobles gradually lost their role in raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies.</p>
	<p> The Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Large numbers of English nobility perished in the Wars of the Roses</p>
	<p> This was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the Renaissance and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the Industrial Revolution. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the bourgeoisie gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant came to be more influential than a nobleman, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles.</p>
	<p> However, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained substantial political importance and social influence: for instance, the United Kingdom's government was dominated by the nobility until the middle of the 19th century. Thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation. However, until 1999, all hereditary peers were entitled to sit and vote in the House of Lords. Since then, only 92 of them have this entitlement, of whom 90 are elected by the hereditary peers as a whole to represent the peerage.</p>
	<p> The countries with the highest proportion of nobles were Castile (probably 10%), Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (15% of an 18th-century population of 800,000), Spain (722,000 in 1768 which was 7–8% of the entire population) and other countries with lower percentages, such as Russia in 1760 with 500,000–600,000 nobles (2–3% of the entire population), and pre-revolutionary France where there were no more than 300,000 prior to 1789, which was 1% of the population (although some scholars believe this figure is an overestimate). In 1718 Sweden had between 10,000 and 15,000 nobles, which was 0.5% of the population. In Germany 0.01%.</p>
	<p> In the Kingdom of Hungary nobles made up 5% of the population. All the nobles in 18th-century Europe numbered perhaps 3–4 million out of a total of 170–190 million inhabitants.</p>

	<p> Many peoples and nations have had noble or aristocratic classes of various kinds: these are so diverse that there may be no clear equivalents in other cultures' histories, and care in translation and context is important to minimize misconstrual, in particular when contrasting concepts and terminology with those derived from Western feudalism.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> China</h3>
	<p> In East Asia the system was often modelled on imperial China, the leading culture. Emperors conferred titles of nobility. Imperial descendants formed the highest class of ancient Chinese nobility, their status based upon the rank of the empress or concubine from which they descend maternally (as emperors were polygamous). Numerous titles such as Taizi (crown prince), and equivalents of "prince" were accorded, and due to complexities in dynastic rules, rules were introduced for Imperial descendants. The titles of the junior princes were gradually lowered in rank by each generation while the senior heir continued to inherit their father's titles.</p>
	<p> It was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties.</p>
	<p> China had a feudal system in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, which gradually gave way to a more bureaucratic one beginning in the Qin dynasty (221 BC). This continued through the Song dynasty, and by its peak power shifted from nobility to bureaucrats.</p>
	<p> This development was gradual and generally only completed in full by the Song dynasty. In the Han dynasty, for example, even though noble titles were no longer given to those other than the Emperor's relatives, the fact that the process of selecting officials was mostly based on a vouching system by current officials as officials usually vouched for their own sons or those of other officials meant that a de facto aristocracy continued to exist. This process was further deepened during the Three Kingdoms period with the introduction of the Nine-rank system.</p>
	<p> By the Sui dynasty, however, the institution of the Imperial examination system marked the transformation of a power shift towards a full bureaucracy, though the process would not be truly completed until the Song dynasty.</p>
	<p> Titles of nobility became symbolic along with a stipend while governance of the country shifted to scholar officials.</p>
	<p> In the Qing dynasty titles of nobility were still granted by the emperor, but served merely as honorifics based on a loose system of favors to the Qing emperor.</p>
	<p> Under a centralized system, the empire's governance was the responsibility of the Confucian-educated scholar-officials and the local gentry, while the literati were accorded gentry status. For male citizens, advancement in status was possible via garnering the top three positions in imperial examinations.</p>
	<p> The Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of Marquis of Extended Grace.</p>
	<p> The oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of Confucius, as Duke Yansheng, which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the Republic of China. The title is held by Kung Tsui-chang. There is also a "Sacrificial Official to Mencius" for a descendant of Mencius, a "Sacrificial Official to Zengzi" for a descendant of Zengzi, and a "Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui" for a descendant of Yan Hui.</p>
	<p> The bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, as part of a larger effort to remove feudal influences and practises from Chinese society.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Islamic world</h3>
	<p> In some Islamic countries, there are no definite noble titles (titles of hereditary rulers being distinct from those of hereditary intermediaries between monarchs and commoners). Persons who can trace legitimate descent from Muhammad or the clans of Quraysh, as can members of several present or formerly reigning dynasties, are widely regarded as belonging to the ancient, hereditary Islamic nobility. In some Islamic countries they inherit (through mother or father) hereditary titles, although without any other associated privilege, e.g., variations of the title Sayyid and Sharif. Regarded as more religious than the general population, many people turn to them for clarification or guidance in religious matters.</p>
	<p> In Iran, historical titles of the nobility including Mirza, Khan, ed-Dowleh and Shahzada ("Son of a Shah), are now no longer recognised. An aristocratic family is now recognised by their family name, often derived from the post held by their ancestors, considering the fact that family names in Iran only appeared in the beginning of the 20th century. Sultans have been an integral part of Islamic history.</p>
	<p> During the Ottoman Empire in the Imperial Court and the provinces there were many Ottoman titles and appellations forming a somewhat unusual and complex system in comparison with the other Islamic countries. The bestowal of noble and aristocratic titles was widespread across the empire even after its fall by independent monarchs. One of the most elaborate examples is that of the Egyptian aristocracy's largest clan, the Abaza family.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Japan</h3>
	<p> Medieval Japan developed a feudal system similar to the European system, where land was held in exchange for military service. The daimyō class, or hereditary landowning nobles, held great socio-political power. As in Europe, they commanded private armies made up of samurai, an elite warrior class; for long periods, these held the real power without a real central government, and often plunged the country into a state of civil war. The daimyō class can be compared to European peers, and the samurai to European knights, but important differences exist.</p>
	<p> Feudal title and rank were abolished during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and was replaced by the kazoku, a five-rank peerage system after the British example, which granted seats in the upper house of the Imperial Diet; this ended in 1947 following Japan's defeat in World War II.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Philippines</h3>
	<p> Like other Southeast Asian countries, many regions in the Philippines have indigenous nobility, partially influenced by Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic custom. Since ancient times, Datu was the common title of a chief or monarch of the many pre-colonial principalities and sovereign dominions throughout the isles; in some areas the term Apo was also used. With the titles Sultan and Rajah, Datu (and its Malay cognate, Datok) are currently used in some parts of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. These titles are the rough equivalents of European titles, albeit dependent on the actual wealth and prestige of the bearer.</p>
	<p> Upon the islands' Christianisation, the datus retained governance of their territories despite annexation to the Spanish Empire. In a law signed 11 June 1594, King Philip II of Spain ordered that the indigenous rulers continue to receive the same honours and privileges accorded them prior their conversion to Catholicism. The baptised nobility subsequently coalesced into the exclusive, landed ruling class of the lowlands known as the Principalía.</p>
	<p> On 22 March 1697, King Charles II of Spain confirmed the privileges granted by his predecessors (in Title VII, Book VI of the Laws of the Indies) to indigenous nobilities of the Crown colonies, including the Principales of the Philippines, and extended to them and to their descendants the preeminence and honors customarily attributed to the Hidalgos of Castile.</p>
	<p> The recognition of the rights and privileges of the Filipino Principalía as equivalent to those of the Hijosdalgos of Castile seems to facilitate entrance of Filipino nobles into institutions of under the Spanish Crown, either civil or religious, which required proofs of nobility. However, such approximation might not be correct since in reality, although the principales were vassals of the Crown, their rights as sovereign in their former dominions were guaranteed by the Laws of the Indies, more particularly the Royal Decree of Philip II of 11 June 1594, which Charles II confirmed for the purpose stated above in order to satisfy the requirements of the existing laws in the Peninsula. It must be recalled that ever since the beginning of the colonialization, the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi did not strip the ancient sovereign rulers of the Archipelago (who vowed allegiance to the Spanish Crown) of their legitimate rights. Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and were his allies from the very beginning. He only demanded from these local rulers vassalage to the Spanish Crown. An interesting question remains after the cessession of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, that is, what is the equivalent of the rank of the Filipino Principalía, freed from vassalage yet not able to exercise their sovereignty within the democratic society in the Archipelago?</p>
	<p> One logical conclusion would be the restoration of their ancient dignity as Datu — the historical dignity of local nobles respected and protected by the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997, the existing pertinent law of the Philippines; and by a related international legislation, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Africa</h4>
	<p> Africa has a plethora of ancient lineages in its various constituent nations. Some, such as the numerous sharifian families of North Africa, the Keita dynasty of Mali, the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia and the Sherbro Tucker clan of Sierra Leone, claim descent from notables from outside of the continent. Most, such as those composed of the descendants of Shaka and Moshoeshoe of Southern Africa, belong to peoples that have been resident in the continent for millennia. Generally their royal or noble status is recognized by and derived from the authority of traditional custom. A number of them also enjoy either a constitutional or a statutory recognition of their high social positions.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ethiopia</h3>
	<p> Ethiopia has a nobility that is almost as old as the country itself. Throughout the history of the Ethiopian Empire most of the titles of nobility have been tribal and/or military in nature. However the Ethiopian nobility resembled its European counterparts in some respects; until 1855, when Tewodros II ended the Zemene Mesafint its aristocracy was organised similarly to the feudal system in Europe during the Middle Ages. For more than seven centuries, Ethiopia (or Abyssinia, as it was then known) was made up of many small kingdoms, principalities, emirates and imamates, which owed their allegiance to the nəgusä nägäst (literally "King of Kings"). Despite its being a Christian monarchy, various Muslim states paid tribute to the emperors of Ethiopia for centuries: including the Adal Sultanate, the Emirate of Harar, and the Awsa sultanate.</p>
	<p> Ethiopian nobility were divided into two different categories: Mesafint ("prince"), the hereditary nobility that formed the upper echelon of the ruling class; and the Mekwanin ("governor") who were appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility (cf. the Ministerialis of the Holy Roman Empire). In Ethiopia there were titles of nobility among the Mesafint borne by those at the apex of medieval Ethiopian society. The highest royal title (after that of emperor) was Negus ("king") which was held by hereditary governors of the provinces of Begemder, Shewa, Gojjam, and Wollo. The next highest seven titles were Ras, Dejazmach, Fit'awrari, Grazmach, Qenyazmach, Azmach and Balambaras. The title of Le'ul Ras was accorded to the heads of various noble families and cadet branches of the Solomonic dynasty, such as the princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selalle. The heirs of the Le'ul Rases were titled Le'ul Dejazmach, indicative of the higher status they enjoyed relative to Dejazmaches who were not of the blood imperial. There were various hereditary titles in Ethiopia: including that of Jantirar, reserved for males of the family of Empress Menen Asfaw who ruled over the mountain fortress of Ambassel in Wollo; Wagshum, a title created for the descendants of the deposed Zagwe dynasty; and Shum Agame, held by the descendants of Dejazmach Sabagadis, who ruled over the Agame district of Tigray. The vast majority of titles borne by nobles were not, however, hereditary.</p>
	<p> Despite being largely dominated by Christian elements, some Muslims obtained entrée into the Ethiopian nobility as part of their quest for aggrandizement during the 1800s. To do so they were generally obliged to abandon their faith and some are believed to have feigned conversion to Christianity for the sake of acceptance by the old Christian aristocratic families. One such family, the Wara Seh (more commonly called the "Yejju dynasty") converted to Christianity and eventually wielded power for over a century, ruling with the sanction of the Solomonic emperors. The last such Muslim noble to join the ranks of Ethiopian society was Mikael of Wollo who converted, was made Negus of Wollo, and later King of Zion, and even married into the Imperial family. He lived to see his son, Iyasu V, inherit the throne in 1913—only to be deposed in 1916 because of his conversion to Islam.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Madagascar</h3>
	<p> The nobility in Madagascar are known as the Andriana. In much of Madagascar, before French colonization of the island, the Malagasy people were organised into a rigid social caste system, within which the Andriana exercised both spiritual and political leadership. The word "Andriana" has been used to denote nobility in various ethnicities in Madagascar: including the Merina, the Betsileo, the Betsimisaraka, the Tsimihety, the Bezanozano, the Antambahoaka and the Antemoro.</p>
	<p> The word Andriana has often formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests that the origin of the title Andriana is traceable back to an ancient Javanese title of nobility. Before the colonization by France in the 1890s, the Andriana held various privileges, including land ownership, preferment for senior government posts, free labor from members of lower classes, the right to have their tombs constructed within town limits, etc. The Andriana rarely married outside their caste: a high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man took on her husband's lower rank, but a high-ranking man marrying a woman of lower rank did not forfeit his status, although his children could not inherit his rank or property (cf. morganatic marriage).</p>
	<p> In 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar endorsed the revival of a Christian Andriana monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Nigeria</h3>
	<p> Contemporary Nigeria has a class of traditional notables whose titles are tied to those of its reigning monarchs, the Nigerian traditional rulers. Though their functions are largely ceremonial, their titles are often centuries old and are usually vested in the members of historically prominent families in the various subnational kingdoms of the country.</p>
	<p> Membership of initiatory societies that have inalienable functions within the kingdoms is also a common feature of Nigerian nobility, particularly among the southern tribes, where such figures as the Ogboni of the Yoruba, the Nze na Ozo of the Igbo and the Ekpe of the Efik are some of the most famous examples. Although many of their traditional functions have lapsed into abeyance with the advent of modern governance, their members retain precedence of a traditional nature and are especially prominent during festivals.</p>
	<p> Outside of this, many of the traditional nobles of Nigeria continue to serve as privy counsellors and viceroys in the service of their traditional sovereigns in a symbolic continuation of the way that their titled ancestors and predecessors did during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Many of them are also members of the country's political elite due to their not being covered by the prohibition from involvement in politics that governs the activities of the traditional rulers.</p>
	<p> Holding a chieftaincy title, either of the traditional variety (which involves taking part in ritual re-enactments of your title's history during annual festivals, roughly akin to a British peerage) or the honorary variety (which does not involve the said re-enactments, roughly akin to a knighthood), grants an individual the right to use the word "chief" as a pre-nominal honourific while in Nigeria.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Latin America</h4>
	<p> In addition to a variety of indigenous peoples (such as the Aymara and the Quechua, who have long traditions of being led by nobles called Apu Mallkus and Mallkus), tribal connections exist among a number of other groups. Peerage traditions dating to the colonial period of such countries as Brazil, Cuba and Mexico have left noble families in each of them that have ancestral ties to those nations' native tribes, while such figures as the Afro-Bolivian king and the high priestess of the Ile Maroia Laji sect of Brazilian Candomblé trace their ancestries to and derive their prestige from ancient monarchs and nobles of the pre-colonial African continent.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Brazil</h3>
	<p> Portrait of Marquis of Paraná, Prime Minister of Brazil.</p>
	<p> The nobility in Brazil began during the colonial era with the Portuguese nobility. When Brazil became a united kingdom with Portugal in 1815, the first Brazilian titles of nobility were granted by the King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.</p>
	<p> With the independence of Brazil in 1822 as a constitutional monarchy the titles of nobility initiated by the King of Portugal were continued and new titles of nobility were created by the Emperor of Brazil. However, according to the Brazilian Constitution of 1824, the Emperor conferred titles of nobility, which were personal and therefore non-hereditary, unlike its Portuguese and Portuguese-Brazilian predecessor, being inherited exclusively to the royal titles of the Brazilian Imperial Family.</p>
	<p> During the existence of the Empire of Brazil 1211 noble titles were acknowledged. With the proclamation of the First Brazilian Republic, in 1889, the Brazilian nobility was extinguished. It was also prohibited, under penalty of accusation of high treason and the suspension of political rights, to accept noble titles and foreign decorations without the proper permission of the State. In particular, the nobles of greater distinction, by respect and tradition, were allowed to use their titles during the republican regime. The Imperial Family also could not return to the Brazilian soil until 1921, when the Banishment Law was repealed.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Pacific Islands</h4>
	<p> Amongst the Polynesians of the Pacific the Ali'i occupied the traditional place of an Aristocratic class. The Kingdoms of Hawaii, Tahiti and presently the Kingdom of Tonga were all ruled by a ruling class known as the Ali'i</p>
	<p> The Ali'i routinely provided the kings and nobles of various Polynesian Kingdoms; including the Kingdom of Hawaii prior to its dissolution 1893, and have served as a bastion of Native Hawaiian revivalism since its occurrence. In Tonga, after contact with Western nations, the traditional system of chiefs was developed into a Western-style monarchy with a hereditary class of "barons", the Tongans even adopting that English title as a synonym for chief.</p>`

	eArt: `Palestine, the Holy Land , or the land of Canaan , is an Asian country, today under Ottoman control. It is a dry, entirely depopulated desert, which is moreover entirely covered with dry rocks. There is no doubt that it was as cultivated as it could have been when the Jews possessed it. They had palms, olive trees, beehives, and they had brought soil to the rocks so as to plant vines, which produced good wine. This soil, mixed with rock shards, was held in place by low walls. However, despite all the efforts of the ancient Jews, Palestine was never able to nourish its inhabitants; thus, it came to be that they spread far and wide, and went on to become the financiers in Asia and Africa that they are today. Alexandria had hardly been built before they had established themselves, and there were eight thousand of them in Rome during the rule of Augustus.
	<p> The current state of Palestine is more miserable than ever: There are only small towns, depopulated villages, and some old, ruined castles to be seen. The flat land is the quarry of the Arabs, who roam its entirety, and as it is only sown and cultivated in a few places, they attack travelers and foreigners to steal from them. The Turkish garrisons are too weak and are spread too thinly to suppress these robberies.</p>
	<p> The few Christians that are in Palestine are amassed in the valley of Lebanon under their Maronite bishops. As far as temporal authority is concerned, they are subject to an Arab leader who calls himself the Emir of Tripoli, and who is a dependent of Turks. The Druze, a people who have a different religion than Christians, Turks, and all of the other peoples in the land, inhabit the Anti-Lebanon Mountains.</p>
	<p> All of Palestine could be seven leagues long, from north to south, stretching from the 31st to the 33rd parallel, and its width perhaps 30 leagues.</p>
	<p> The pilgrims divide it into three provinces: Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, each governed by an Emir, subject to the will of an overlord, who, apart from this Emir, maintains there two Sanjaks which are subordinate to the Pasha of Damascus.</p>
	<p> These three Emirs are the Emir of Saida, the Emir of Caesarea, and the Emir of Gaza; the two Sanjaks take the names of their residences, Jerusalem and Nablus. Beyond the Jordan is what is known as the Kingdom of the Arabs. This kingdom consists of immense deserts, of which the king is an independent sovereign, who does not recognize the authority of the Porte.</p>
	<p> According to Father Nau, Palestine today includes the land of Gaza; Al-Khalil, or Hebron; the land of Al-Quds, or Jerusalem; the land of Neapolis, or Nablus; the land of Harcté; the land of Kafr Kanna, or Nazareth; the country of Safed; and finally, the region above Jordan, where it is dangerous to travel because of the Arabs who occupy it. He adds that these diverse regions form so many governments of which the number, however, is not at all fixed because the overlord oftentimes divides a government in two, and oftentimes he combines them.</p>
	<p> One should be cautious of the description of the places made famous by Holy Scripture. We have been given very suspect, circumstantial descriptions. What don’t they claim to show to those who undertake the pilgrimage to Palestine , and what is not offered to them to compensate them for their efforts? They are shown through imagination the place where Saint Epiphanius, born in Palestine around the year 320, founded a monastery himself. This father of the Church died in 403, and was older than 80. The best edition of his works is that of Father Petau, which was published in Greek and Latin in 1622, in folio, with scholarly notes. In these notes, however, he was unable to rectify either the errors or the lack of precision of Saint Epiphanius in the facts that he reports.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Palestine (Arabic: فلسطين‎‎ Filasṭīn, Falasṭīn, Filisṭīn; Greek: Παλαιστίνη, Palaistinē; Latin: Palaestina; Hebrew: פלשתינה Palestina) is a geographic region in Western Asia between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. It is sometimes considered to include adjoining territories. The name was used by Ancient Greek writers, and was later used for the Roman province Syria Palaestina, the Byzantine Palaestina Prima, and the Islamic provincial district of Jund Filastin. The region comprises most of the territory claimed for the biblical regions known as the Land of Israel (Hebrew: ארץ־ישראל Eretz-Yisra'el), the Holy Land or Promised Land. Historically, it has been known as the southern portion of wider regional designations such as Canaan, Syria, ash-Sham, and the Levant.</p>
	<p> Situated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including Ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites and Judeans, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Ancient Greeks and Macedonians, the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom, Romans, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis, Jordanians, Egyptians and Palestinians.</p>
	<p> The boundaries of the region have changed throughout history. Today, the region comprises the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories in which the State of Palestine was declared.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History of the name</h4>
	<p> Modern archaeology has identified 12 ancient inscriptions from Egyptian and Assyrian records recording likely cognates of Hebrew Pelesheth. The term "Peleset" (transliterated from hieroglyphs as P-r-s-t) is found in five inscriptions referring to a neighboring people or land starting from c. 1150 BCE during the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt. The first known mention is at the temple at Medinet Habu which refers to the Peleset among those who fought with Egypt in Ramesses III's reign, and the last known is 300 years later on Padiiset's Statue. Seven known Assyrian inscriptions refer to the region of "Palashtu" or "Pilistu", beginning with Adad-nirari III in the Nimrud Slab in c. 800 BCE through to a treaty made by Esarhaddon more than a century later. Neither the Egyptian nor the Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.</p>
	<p> The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt was in 5th century BC Ancient Greece, when Herodotus wrote of a 'district of Syria, called Palaistinê" in The Histories, which included the Judean mountains and the Jordan Rift Valley. Approximately a century later, Aristotle used a similar definition for the region in Meteorology, in which he included the Dead Sea. Later Greek writers such as Polemon and Pausanias also used the term to refer to the same region, which was followed by Roman writers such as Ovid, Tibullus, Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Dio Chrysostom, Statius, Plutarch as well as Roman Judean writers Philo of Alexandria and Josephus. The term was first used to denote an official province in c.135 CE, when the Roman authorities, following the suppression of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, combined Iudaea Province with Galilee and the Paralia to form "Syria Palaestina". There is circumstantial evidence linking Hadrian with the name change, but the precise date is not certain and the assertion of some scholars that the name change was intended "to complete the dissociation with Judaea" is disputed.</p>
	<p> The term is generally accepted to be a translation of the Biblical name Peleshet (פלשת Pəlésheth, usually transliterated as Philistia). The term and its derivates are used more than 250 times in Masoretic-derived versions of the Hebrew Bible, of which 10 uses are in the Torah, with undefined boundaries, and almost 200 of the remaining references are in the Book of Judges and the Books of Samuel. The term is rarely used in the Septuagint, who used a transliteration Land of Phylistieim (Γῆ τῶν Φυλιστιείμ) different from the contemporary Greek place name Palaistínē (Παλαιστίνη).</p>
	<p> The Septuagint instead used the term "allophuloi" (άλλόφυλοι, "other nations") throughout the Books of Judges and Samuel, such that the term "Philistines" has been interpreted to mean "non-Israelites of the Promised Land" when used in the context of Samson, Saul and David, and Rabbinic sources explain that these peoples were different from the Philistines of the Book of Genesis.</p>
	<p> During the Byzantine period, the region of Palestine within Syria Palaestina was subdivided into Palaestina Prima and Secunda, and an area of land including the Negev and Sinai became Palaestina Salutaris. Following the Muslim conquest, place names that were in use by the Byzantine administration generally continued to be used in Arabic. The use of the name "Palestine" became common in Early Modern English, was used in English and Arabic during the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem and was revived as an official place name with the British Mandate for Palestine.</p>
	<p> Some other terms that have been used to refer to all or part of this land include Canaan, Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael or Ha'aretz), Greater Syria, the Holy Land, Iudaea Province, Judea, Coele-Syria, "Israel HaShlema", Kingdom of Israel, Kingdom of Jerusalem, Zion, Retenu (Ancient Egyptian), Southern Syria, Southern Levant and Syria Palaestina.</p>

	<h4> History</h4>
	<h3> Overview</h3>
	<p> Situated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including Ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians. Modern archaeologists and historians of the region refer to their field of study as Levantine archaeology.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ancient period</h3>
	<p> Depiction of Biblical Palestine in c. 1020 BCE according to George Adam Smith's 1915 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land. Smith's book was used as a reference by Lloyd George during the negotiations for the British Mandate for Palestine.</p>
	<p> The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. During the Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria. Between 1550–1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian New Kingdom who held power until the 1178 BCE Battle of Djahy (Canaan) during the wider Bronze Age collapse. The Israelites emerged from a dramatic social transformation that took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere.</p>
	<p> The region became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from c. 740 BCE, which was itself replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in c. 627 BCE. According to the Bible, a war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II and the local leaders of the region of Judea were deported to Babylonia. In 539 BCE, the Babylonian empire was replaced by the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Bible and implications from the Cyrus Cylinder, the exiled population of Judea was allowed to return to Jerusalem. Southern Palestine became a province of the Achaemenid Empire, called Idumea, and the evidence from ostraca suggests that a Nabataean-type society, since the Idumeans appear to be connected to the Nabataeans, took shape in southern Palestine in the 4th century B.C.E., and that the Qedarite Arab kingdom penetrated throughout this area through the period of Persian and Hellenistic dominion.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Classical antiquity</h3>
	<p> In the 330s BCE, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the region, which changed hands several times during the wars of the Diadochi and later Syrian Wars. It ultimately fell to the Seleucid Empire between 219–200 BCE. In 116 BCE, a Seleucid civil war resulted in the independence of certain regions including the Hasmonean principality in the Judaean Mountains. From 110 BCE, the Hasmoneans extended their authority over much of Palestine, creating a Judaean–Samaritan–Idumaean–Ituraean–Galilean alliance. The Judaean (Jewish, see Ioudaioi) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as Judaea, a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the Judaean Mountains. Between 73–63 BCE, the Roman Republic extended its influence into the region in the Third Mithridatic War, conquering Judea in 63 BCE, and splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. The three-year Ministry of Jesus, culminating in his crucifixion, is estimated to have occurred from 28–30 CE, although the historicity of Jesus is disputed by a minority of scholars. In 70 CE, Titus sacked Jerusalem, resulting in the dispersal of the city's Jews and Christians to Yavne and Pella. In 132 CE, Hadrian joined the province of Iudaea with Galilee and the Paralia to form new province of Syria Palaestina, and Jerusalem was renamed "Aelia Capitolina". Between 259–272, the region fell under the rule of Odaenathus as King of the Palmyrene Empire. Following the victory of Christian emperor Constantine in the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy, the Christianization of the Roman Empire began, and in 326, Constantine's mother Saint Helena visited Jerusalem and began the construction of churches and shrines. Palestine became a center of Christianity, attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The Samaritan Revolts during this period caused their near extinction. In 614 CE, Palestine was annexed by another Persian dynasty; the Sassanids, until returning to Byzantine control in 628 CE.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Middle Ages</h3>
	<p> Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, beginning in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim conquest of the Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.</p>
	<p> The majority of the population was Christian and was to remain so until the conquest of Saladin in 1187. The Muslim conquest apparently had little impact on social and administrative continuities for several decades. The word 'Arab' at the time referred predominantly to Bedouin nomads, though Arab settlement is attested in the Judean highlands and near Jerusalem by the 5th century, and some tribes had converted to Christianity. The local population engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, and were called Nabaț, referring to Aramaic-speaking villagers. A ḥadīth, brought in the name of a Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine, ordered the Muslim Arabs not to settle in the villages, "for he who abides in villages it is as if he abides in graves".</p>
	<p> The Umayyads, who had spurred a strong economic resurgence in the area, were replaced by the Abbasids in 750. Ramla became the administrative centre for the following centuries, while Tiberias became a thriving centre of Muslim scholarship. From 878, Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with the Turkish freeman Ahmad ibn Tulun, for whom both Jews and Christians prayed when he lay dying and ending with the Ikhshidid rulers. Reverence for Jerusalem increased during this period, with many of the Egyptian rulers choosing to be buried there. However, the later period became characterized by persecution of Christians as the threat from Byzantium grew. The Fatimids, with a predominantly Berber army, conquered the region in 970, a date that marks the beginning of a period of unceasing warfare between numerous enemies, which destroyed Palestine, and in particular devastating its Jewish population. Between 1071-73, Palestine was captured by the Great Seljuq Empire, only to be recaptured by the Fatimids in 1098, who then lost the region to the Crusaders in 1099. Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until their defeat by Saladin's forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. A rump crusader state in the northern coastal cities survived for another century, but, despite seven further crusades, the Crusaders were no longer a significant power in the region. The Fourth Crusade, which did not reach Palestine, led directly to the decline of the Byzantine Empire, dramatically reducing Christian influence throughout the region.</p>
	<p> The Mamluk Sultanate was indirectly created in Egypt as a result of the Seventh Crusade. The Mongol Empire reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the Mongol raids into Palestine under Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and reaching an apex at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut, where they were routed by the Mamluks.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Ottoman era</h3>
	<p> In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government).</p>
	<p> In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan under the leadership of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.</p>
	<p> In 1830, on the eve of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns.</p>
	<p> In 1840, Britain intervened and returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and the revival of the Hebrew language and culture. The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> British mandate and partition</h3>
	<p> The British began their Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1915. The war reached southern Palestine in 1917, progressing to Gaza and around Jerusalem by the end of the year. The British secured Jerusalem in December 1917. They moved into the Jordan valley in 1918 and a campaign by the Entente into northern Palestine led to victory at Megiddo in September.</p>
	<p> The British were formally awarded the mandate to govern the region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Post–1948</h3>
	<p> In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory, Jordan captured the region of Judea and Samaria, renaming it the "West Bank", while the Gaza Strip was captured by Egypt. Following the 1948 Palestinian exodus, also known as al-Nakba, the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes were not allowed to return following the Lausanne Conference of 1949.</p>
	<p> In the course of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.</p>
	<p> In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a separation barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous aspects of the territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem continues to be the world's longest military occupation in modern times.</p>
	<p> In November 2012, the status of Palestinian delegation in the United Nations was upgraded to non-member observer state as the State of Palestine.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Boundaries</h4>
	<h3> Ancient and Medieval</h3>
	<p> The boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.</p>
	<p> The boundaries of the area and the ethnic nature of the people referred to by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE as Palaestina vary according to context. Sometimes, he uses it to refer to the coast north of Mount Carmel. Elsewhere, distinguishing the Syrians in Palestine from the Phoenicians, he refers to their land as extending down all the coast from Phoenicia to Egypt. Pliny, writing in Latin in the 1st century CE, describes a region of Syria that was "formerly called Palaestina" among the areas of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
	<p> Since the Byzantine Period, the Byzantine borders of Palaestina (I and II, also known as Palaestina Prima, "First Palestine", and Palaestina Secunda, "Second Palestine"), have served as a name for the geographic area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Under Arab rule, Filastin (or Jund Filastin) was used administratively to refer to what was under the Byzantines Palaestina Secunda (comprising Judaea and Samaria), while Palaestina Prima (comprising the Galilee region) was renamed Urdunn ("Jordan" or Jund al-Urdunn).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Modern period</h3>
	<p> Nineteenth-century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.</p>
	<p> The British administered Mandatory Palestine after World War I, having promised to establish a homeland for the Jewish people. The modern definition of the region follows the boundaries of that entity, which were fixed in the North and East in 1920-23 by the British Mandate for Palestine (including the Transjordan memorandum) and the Paulet–Newcombe Agreement, and on the South by following the 1906 Turco-Egyptian boundary agreement.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Current usage</h3>
	<p> The region of Palestine is the eponym for the Palestinian people and the culture of Palestine, both of which are defined as relating to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of Mandatory Palestine. The 1968 Palestinian National Covenant described Palestine as the "homeland of the Arab Palestinian people", with "the boundaries it had during the British Mandate".</p>
	<p> However, since the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the term State of Palestine refers only to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This discrepancy was described by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a negotiated concession in a September 2011 speech to the United Nations: "... we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine - on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967."</p>
	<p> The term Palestine is also sometimes used in a limited sense to refer to the parts of the Palestinian territories currently under the administrative control of the Palestinian National Authority, a quasi-governmental entity which governs parts of the State of Palestine under the terms of the Oslo Accords.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Demographics</h4>
	<h3> Early demographics</h3>
	<p> Estimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.</p>
	<p> According to Israeli archaeologists Magen Broshi and Yigal Shiloh, the population of ancient Palestine did not exceed one million. By 300AD, Christianity had spread so significantly that Jews comprised only a quarter of the population.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods</h3>
	<p> In the middle of the 1st century of the Ottoman rule, i.e. 1550 AD, Bernard Lewis in a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman Rule of Palestine reports:</p>
	<p> From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem, Gaza, Safed, Nablus, Ramle, and Hebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.</p>
	<p> Historical population table compiled by Sergio DellaPergola. Figures in thousands.</p>
	<p> According to Alexander Scholch, the population of Palestine in 1850 was about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews.</p>
	<p> According to Ottoman statistics studied by Justin McCarthy, the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of whom 94% were Arabs. In 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews. McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882; 737,389 in 1914; 725,507 in 1922; 880,746 in 1931; and 1,339,763 in 1946.</p>
	<p> In 1920, the League of Nations' Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine described the 700,000 people living in Palestine as follows:</p>
	<p> Of these, 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.</p>
	<p> The Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850, there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years, a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Current demographics</h3>
	<p> According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2015, the total population of Israel was 8.5 million people, of which 75% were Jews, 21% Arabs, and 4% "others." Of the Jewish group, 76% were Sabras (born in Israel); the rest were olim (immigrants) — 16% from Europe, the former Soviet republics, and the Americas, and 8% from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.</p>
	<p> According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics evaluations, in 2015 the Palestinian population of the West Bank was approximately 2.9 million and that of the Gaza Strip was 1.8 million. Gaza's population is expected to increase to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.</p>
	<p> Both Israeli and Palestinian statistics include Arab residents of East Jerusalem in their reports. According to these estimates the total population in the region of Palestine, as defined as Israel and the Palestinian territories, stands approximately 12.8 million.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Philosophy. Philosophy etymologically means love of knowledge. Due to its various meanings this word has always been quite vague. It is therefore necessary to accomplish two things in this article; 1. to give an historical account of the origin and the different meanings of this term; 2. to establish its meaning by a good definition.</p>
	<p> 1. What is called Philosophy today was initially called sophia or wisdom, and we know that the first philosophers were awarded the title of the wise. In previous times, the word meant what the word bel esprit means to us today; that is to say, it graced a large number of people who were worthy of nothing less than this magnificent description. In that time the human mind was in its infancy and one heard the word wisdom applied to all the arts that exercised ingenuity or that benefited society in some way. However since erudition, like knowledge, is one of the the principal ways to cultivate the mind, and since the sciences when studied and applied bring many advantages to the human species, wisdom and erudition became confused, and people came to view as being well-versed or instructed in wisdom he who possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of what was known in the century in which he lived.</p>
	<p> Among all the Sciences there is one that distinguishes itself by the excellence of its object; it is the one that treats of divinity, that forms our ideas and our emotions with respect to the Supreme Being and that tailors our worship of him. This study, wisdom par excellence, has given the word wise to those who have applied themselves to it; namely, to Theologians and to Priests. Even Scripture ascribes the quality of being wise to Chaldean priests , without doubt because they arrogated it to themselves and because it was a universally accepted usage. This was primarily the case in the nations we customary call barbarian; it was far from the case, however, that one could find wisdom in all custodians of religion. The wisdom of the priests of this era was reduced to ridiculous superstitions, childish and sometimes abominable mysteries and to visions and lies destined to confirm their authority and to impose it on the blind mob. The most distinguished philosophers first tried to drink from this source: it was the goal of their journeys and their initiation into the most famous mysteries; but they soon became disgusted of it – and the idea of wisdom has only remained linked to that of Theology in the mind of these proud priests and their idiotic slaves.</p>
	<p> Sublime geniuses engaged in their meditations sought to deduce solid wisdom and an unquestionable system resting on unshakable foundations from the ideas and principles that nature and reason supply. Nonetheless, even if they were in this way able to cast off the yoke of common superstitions, the rest of their venture did not have the same success. After having destroyed they did not know how to construct, similar in a way to those conquerors who leave nothing but ruins behind them. Hence the raft of bizarre and contradictory opinions that raise doubt as to whether there is any ridiculous idea left out there that no philosopher has yet dared to entertain. I cannot stop myself from quoting a passage from M. de Fontenelle, taken from his essay on the Ancients and the Moderns that perfectly addresses this matter. ‘Such is our condition’, he says, ‘that we are never permitted to reach anything reasonable, regardless the subject, all at once. Before this, it is necessary that we go astray for a long time and that we fall into various kinds of errors and varying degrees of impertinence. It should always have been fairly easy to become aware that the whole system of nature consists of figures and the movements of bodies; yet before reaching this point, it was necessary to try the ideas of Plato, Pythagoras’ numbers and Aristotle’s qualities; and only once all this was recognized as false were we obliged to adopt the true system. I say that we were obliged because no other system remained, and it seemed as if we had refrained from taking it for as long as we could. We had an obligation to the Ancients to exhaust the largest number of false ideas as we possibly could; it was absolutely necessary to pay to error and ignorance the tribute that they paid, and we must not lack gratitude toward those who have absolved us from this charge. The same is true for various subjects on which I know not what nonsense we would have produced if it had not already been written, and if we had not already, so to say, been relieved from having to do so. Nonetheless, there are still sometimes modern people who repeat it, perhaps because its silliness has still not surfaced to a visible level’.</p>
	<p> This would have been the place to make a summary of the various opinions that have been fashionable in Philosophy , but the length of our article does not permit it. One can find the essence of the most famous opinions in various other places of this Dictionary under the headings that address them. For those who want to study the matter in depth, they can find abundant and satisfying information in the excellent work that M. Brucker first published in German and then in Latin with the title: Jacobi Bruckeri historia critica Philosophioe. à mundi incunabulis ad nostram usque aetatem deducta. One can also read the history of Philosophy by M. Deslandes.</p>
	<p> Ignorance, haste, pride and jealousy have given birth to monsters whose existence is damning for Philosophy , and who have either turned some away from studying it or thrown others into universal doubt.</p>
	<p> But let’s not exaggerate. The flaws of the human mind have not prevented Philosophy from making considerable advances and from tending toward the perfection that is possible here on this Earth. The Ancients said excellent things, especially concerning moral duties and even concerning what humans owe to God; and even if they were not able to live up to the beautiful idea that they formed of wisdom, at least they should be given credit for the glory of having envisioned it and of having attempted such a challenge. In their hands wisdom became a practical science that encompassed both divine and human truths; that is to say, everything that the understanding is capable of discovering about divinity and about that which can contribute to the wellbeing of society. As soon as they had given it a systematic form they began to teach it and schools and sects were soon developed. Since to make their precepts better received they dressed them up with eloquence, this imperceptibly became confused with wisdom, especially for the Greeks who attached great importance to the art of speaking elegantly because of its influence on affairs of the state in their republics. The word wise was thus distorted into those of sophist or master of eloquence , and this transformation very much caused a science that originally had contained much nobler ideas to degenerate. Soon the masters of wisdom were no longer listened to as a means to educate oneself in solid knowledge useful for one's wellbeing but to entertain the mind with idle questions, amuse the ears with rhythmic periods, and award a prize to the most tenacious simply because he remained master of the battlefield.</p>
	<p> The word wise was too beautiful to accredit such people, or rather it is not appropriate for human beings: it is the privilege of divinity, the eternal and inexhaustible source of true wisdom. Pythagoras, who realized this, substituted for this magnificent denomination the modest title of philosopher , which established itself in the way that it has solely been used ever since. But the wise reasons for this change did not suffocated the pride of the philosophers, who continued to want to pose as the agents of true wisdom. One of the most ordinary means that they used to stand out was to have a so-called occult teaching which was only shared with their inner circle, whereas the crowd of listeners were fed on vague instructions. The Philosophers had doubtless taken this idea and these methods from priests, who would only provide an initiation into the knowledge of their mysteries after extensive trials; but the secrets of both groups were not worth the time that it took to obtain them.</p>
	<p> In the philosophical works of antiquity preserved for us, though marked by many failures – especially the failure of a having good method – we nonetheless discover the seeds of most modern discoveries. The subjects that did not need any reinforcement from observations and instruments, like those of ethics, were pushed as far as reason could take them. As for Physics, favored by the assistance that the last centuries have given it, it not surprising that it today largely outruns that of the Ancients. We should rather be surprised that these men guessed so remarkably in such a remarkable number of cases, given that they could not see what we can see today. The same must be said for Medicine and Mathematics. As these sciences are composed of an infinite number of aspects and are largely dependent on the experiences that only chance can provide and never brings on demand, it is evident that our Physicists, Physicians and Mathematicians must naturally be more skillful than the ancient ones.</p>
	<p> The word Philosophy always remained vague and contained in its vast breadth – other than the knowledge of divine and human things – the knowledge of laws, of Medicine, and of the various branches of scholarship, such as Grammar, Rhetoric, and Criticism, without excluding History and Poesy. A great deal more than that in fact: it appeared in the Church and Christianity was called holy philosophy , while the doctors of religion who taught its truths and the ascetics who practiced its austerities were termed philosophers.</p>
	<p> The divisions of a science understood in such general terms were very arbitrary. The most ancient and the most accepted division was the one that related Philosophy to the consideration of God and to that of human beings.</p>
	<p> Aristotle introduced a new division, as presented here: ‘Tria genera sunt theoreticarum scientiarum, Mathematica, Physica, Theologica. A passage from Seneca will indicate that of several other sects: Stoïcii vero Philosophiae tres partes esse dixerunt, moralem, naturalem, & rationalem: prima componit animum, secunda rerum naturam scrutatur, tertia proprietatis verborum exigit & structuram & argumentationes, ne pro veris falsa subrepant. Epicurei duas partes Philosophiae putaverunt esse, naturalem atque moralem; rationalem removerunt. Deinde cum ipsis rebus cogerentur ambigua secernere, falsa sub specie veri latentia coarguere, ipsi quoque locum, quem de judicio & regula appellant, alio nomine rationalem induxerunt: sed eum accessionem esse naturalis partis existimant... Cyrenaïci naturalia cum rationalibus sustulerunt, & contenti fuerunt moralibus, &c’. Seneca, epist. 89.</p>
	<p> The Schools admitted four sections in the division of Philosophy : Logic, Metaphysics, Physics and Ethics.</p>
	<p> 2. It is time to proceed to the second aim of this article: to establish the meaning of the word Philosophy and to give a good definition of it. To philosophize is to give reasons for things or at least to search for them, because as long as we limit ourselves to observing and reporting, we are only historians, and when one calculates and measures the proportions of things, their magnitude and their values, then one is a mathematician; but he who stops to uncover the reasons for the being of things and for them being in a certain way and not another is the philosopher per se.</p>
	<p> That said, M. Wolf’s definition of Philosophy seems to me to contain in its brevity all that which characterizes this science. It is, according to him, the science of the possible as possible. It is a science since it demonstrates what it puts forward. It is the science of the possible since its goal is to account for all that which is and all that which can be in everything that happens; the contrary could also happen. In other words I hate someone but could love him, a body occupies a certain place in the universe but could occupy another, and yet these different possibilities cannot exist simultaneously. A reason thus determines the existence of one rather than the other and it is this reason that the philosopher pursues and determines.</p>
	<p> This definition embraces the present, the past and the future and that which has never existed and will never exist, such as all universal ideas and abstractions. Such a science is a true encyclopedia; everything is related to it, everything depends on it. It is what the Ancients felt when they applied the word Philosophy to all kinds of sciences and arts as we saw above, but they did not account for this science’s universal influence on all the other sciences. This influence is only made clear in the definition of M. Wolf. The possible consists of all the subjects that can occupy the mind or the industry of men, including all the sciences and the arts, which all have their own philosophy. It is clear that in Jurisprudence, in Medicine, and in Politics, everything happens – or at least should happen – for some reason. To uncover and to determine these reasons are thus the philosophy of the abovementioned sciences; just as the architect, the painter and the sculptor – and I would even argue, the simple lumberjack has his reasons for doing what and how he does and does not do it. It is true that most of these people work by routine and use their tools without consciousness of their mechanisms and their suitability for the work that they execute; but it is no less certain that every tool has its reasons, and that, if it were differently made, the work would not succeed. It is only the philosopher who can make these discoveries and who is able to prove that things are as they must be, or to adjust them when possible by indicating the reason for the changes that he wishes to make.</p>
	<p> The objects of Philosophy are the same as those of our general knowledge and they establish the natural divisions of this science. They can be broken down to three main themes, God, the soul and matter. These three correspond to the three main categories of Philosophy. The first is natural Theology or the science of the possible in respect to God, namely, what one can conceive in him and by him. There are also definitions of the possible in respect to the soul and the body. The second is Psychology , which concerns the possible in respect to the soul. The third is Physics , which concerns the possible in respect to the body.</p>
	<p> This general definition of Philosophy also admits of particular subcategories; below is M. Wolf’s way of envisaging them.</p>
	<p> When we are self-reflective, we convince ourselves that there is a faculty inside us that forms ideas concerning possible things and we call this faculty the understanding; yet it is not easy to know the extent of this faculty, nor how one should use it to discover truths unknown to us by our own meditation or to accurately judge those that others have already discovered. Our first endeavor should therefore be to investigate the powers of the human understanding and their legitimate use with respect to the knowledge of the truth. The branch of Philosophy that treats this subject is called logic or the art of thinking.</p>
	<p> Among all the possible things it is of great necessity that there exist a being that subsists by himself; otherwise there would be possible things whose possibility for which one could not account, which would not make sense. Now this being that subsists by itself we call God. The other beings which owe the reason for their existence to this being subsisting by himself have the name creatures. Nonetheless, since Philosophy should account for the possibility of things, it is logical to place the doctrine that treats God before the one treating the creatures. I admit nevertheless that one should already have a general knowledge of the creatures, but we do not need to draw it from Philosophy since we have acquired it by our continual experience from childhood. Thus the branch of Philosophy in which one treats God and the origin of the creatures that spring from him is called natural Theology or doctrine of God.</p>
	<p> Creatures either manifest their activity by movement or by thinking; the first are bodies, the latter minds. Because Philosophy attempts to provide sufficient reasons for everything, it should also examine the powers or operations of these beings that act either by movement or by thinking. Philosophy thereby shows us what can happen in the world by the powers of bodies and the strength of minds. We call pneumatology or doctrine of minds the branch of Philosophy that explains what minds can do; and we call physics or doctrine of nature the other branch that shows what is possible in virtue of the power of bodies.</p>
	<p> The being that thinks in us is called soul. Now as this soul is in the category of mind and has, apart from the understanding, a will that causes a number of events, it is necessary that Philosophy explores what can happen as a consequence of it. What one teaches regarding the laws of nature, ethics and politics should relate to this.</p>
	<p> But because all beings – either bodies, minds or souls – resemble each other in some way, it is necessary to also investigate what is generally applicable to all beings and what their general differences consist of. We call ontology or fundamental science the branch of philosophy that contains the general knowledge of all beings. This fundamental science, the doctrine of minds and natural theology compose that which is called metaphysics or first science.</p>
	<p> Yet we are not satisfied with extending our knowledge to an understanding of the forces that produce certain effects in nature; we will go further and measure exactly the magnitude of these forces and their effects, so that it seems clear that a certain force produces certain effects. For example, a lot of people are content with knowing that air, when powerfully compressed in an artificial fountain, propels water to an extraordinary height; but others, who are more curious, make efforts to discover by how much the force of the air increases when the compression occupies no more than a half, a third or a quarter of the space that it filled previously, and by how many feet the water increases in each case. It is to extend our knowledge to its highest degree and to know how to measure everything which has size and magnitude that we have invented mathematics.</p>
	<p> The true order according to which the branches of Philosophy should be organized is to start with those that contain principles that must be known in order to understand and demonstrate those that follow after them; it is to this kind of order that M. Wolf is faithfully true, as is shown in the quotation from him that I just provided.</p>
	<p> This said, one can still divide Philosophy into two branches and consider it in two respects, one theoretical and one practical.</p>
	<p> Theoretical or speculative Philosophy relies on a pure and simple contemplation of things and does not go further.</p>
	<p> Practical Philosophy on the other hand gives rules for action with respect to its objects. It is of two kinds with respect to the two kinds of human actions that it tries to steer: these are Logic and Ethics. Logic steers the operations of understanding and Ethics the operations of the will. See Logic and Morals. The other branches of Philosophy are purely speculative.</p>
	<p> Philosophy is also ordinarily understood to mean the particular doctrine or the invented systems of renowned philosophers who have had followers. Philosophy thus understood can be divided into an infinite number of sects, as many ancient as modern, such as the Platonists, the Peripatetics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, the Pythagoreans, the Pyrrhonists and the Academicians; and those of our days, the Cartesians and the Newtonians. See the origin and the dogma of each sect in their respective articles.</p>
	<p> Philosophy can also be taken to mean a certain way of philosophizing or certain principles on which all the investigations that we carry out by its means are dependent. This is why we say corpuscular Philosophy , mechanistic Philosophy and experimental Philosophy.</p>
	<p> Such is a sound notion of Philosophy; its goal is certainty and all its steps proceed towards it by way of demonstration. For this reason, what characterizes Philosophy and distinguishes it from everyday thought is that it does not admit of anything without evidence, it does not acquiesce in accepting erroneous notions, and it establishes the exact limits of certainty, probability, and doubt. It is not all talk and it explains nothing by occult qualities which are nothing else but an effect transformed into its own cause; it much prefers to confess its ignorance every time that reasoning and experience are not able to lead it to discover the true reason for things.</p>
	<p> Philosophy is still a highly imperfect science and it will never be complete – because who could provide an account of everything possible? The being who has created everything that has weight and measure is the only one who has a perfect philosophical and mathematical knowledge of his work; yet human beings are no less praiseworthy for studying the great book of nature and for searching in it evidence of the wisdom and all the perfections of its author. Society also obtains great advantages from philosophical investigations, which have caused and perfected several useful discoveries for mankind.</p>
	<p> The greatest philosopher is he who can account for the greatest number of things. This is how his rank is defined with precision, and in this way Philosophy is no longer in danger of being confused with erudition. Knowledge of facts is unarguably useful, it is even an essential prerequisite for explaining them; but to be a philosopher is not only to have seen and read a lot, nor to know the history of Philosophy and the sciences and the arts by heart – all this often causes no more than an undigested chaos – but instead to have solid principles and above all a good method to account for these facts and to draw legitimate consequences from them.</p>
	<p> Two principal obstacles have for a long time delayed the progress of Philosophy , authority and the obsession with system.</p>
	<p> A true philosopher does not see with the eyes of others, he only surrenders to convictions based on evidence. It is relatively difficult to understand how it can be that people who possess genius prefer to serve the genius of others in the search for truth rather than the one that God has given them. It is without doubt infinitely more enjoyable and more honorable to be driven by one’s own eyes than those of others, and a human being whose eyes are good can never take it into his head to close them or tear them out in hope of following another. It is however a fairly common practice; Père Malebranche provides various reasons for it.</p>
	<p> 1. The natural laziness of human beings who do not want to go through the trouble of reflecting.</p>
	<p> 2. The inability to reflect which one suffers by not having exercised one's faculties since youth, when the fibers of the brain were capable of all sorts of inflections.</p>
	<p> 3. The limited interest that one has in the abstract truths that are the foundations of everything that one can know on Earth.</p>
	<p> 4. The foolish vanity that makes us wish that we were esteemed scholars, since scholars are those who are widely read. Knowledge of opinion is more useful for conversation and for impressing vulgar minds than knowledge of true Philosophy , which is the fruit of reflection.</p>
	<p> 5. The excessive admiration that one has for the ancestors, which makes one imagine that they were more enlightened than one could ever be and that there is nothing to be done where they have not already succeeded.</p>
	<p> 6. Some respect or other mixed with a foolish curiosity makes us admire the things that are most remote from us more, the oldest things, the things that come from furthest away and even the most obscure books. Thus in the past we esteemed Heraclites because of his obscurity. We search for ancient coins although they be plagued by rust and we attentively preserve the lamp and slippers of our ancestors, whose antiquity makes them valuable. People apply themselves to the teachings of rabbis because they wrote in a highly corrupt and obscure foreign language. We have more esteem for the oldest opinions because they are furthest away from us; and without a doubt, if Nimrod had written the history of his reign, it would have included all the most refined politics and even all of the other sciences, just as some consider that Homer and Virgil had a perfect knowledge of nature. We have been told that it is necessary to respect antiquity; what, might Aristotle, Plato, and Epicurus – all these great men – have been mistaken? We do not believe that Aristotle, Plato and Epicurus were men like us and of the same kind as us. What is more, we do not believe that in our time – the world is two thousand years older – since there is more experience there must be more enlightenment; and that it is the world’s age and experience that allow truth to be discovered.</p>
	<p> ‘A good mind that is cultivated and of our age’, says M. de Fontenelle, ‘is so to speak composed of all the minds of the previous ages; it is but one same spirit that has been cultivated during all this time. Thus this being who has lived since the beginning of the world until now has had his childhood during which he was only occupied with life’s most essential needs; and his adolescence during which he was quite successful with imaginary things, such as poetry and eloquence, and during which he even began to reason, albeit with less truth than passion. He is now in the age of virility in which he reasons more powerfully and is more enlightened than ever. This human being, strictly speaking, will never be old, he will always be equally capable of the things which properly occupied him in his youth and he will be more and more capable of those suited to the age of virility, that is to say – to conclude the allegory – human beings never degenerate, and the sound opinions of all the good minds that are to come will always be added to those that preceded them.</p>
	<p> These sound and judicious reflections ought to cure us of the ridiculous prejudices that we have adopted in favor of our ancestors. If our reason, supported by the vanity that comes so naturally to us, is not capable of removing such a truly misplaced humility, as if we had not the right as human beings to aspire to such a great perfection, at least experience will be sufficiently strong to convince us that nothing has stopped the progress of things and nothing has limited our minds as much as this excessive admiration for the ancestors. ‘Because we were devoted to the authority of Aristotle’, says M. de Fontenelle, ‘and we did not search for truth other than in his enigmatic writings and never in nature, not only did Philosophy not advance in any way, but it fell into an abyss of gibberish and unintelligible ideas from which we have had all the difficulties in the world to pull it out. Aristotle never made a real philosopher but he suffocated many of those who might have become one if he had been allowed. And the harm is that a folly of this kind once it gets established among human beings remains for a long time; we will need entire centuries to get over it even after we have recognized its ridiculousness. If one day we decided to get hung up on Descartes and put him in the place of Aristotle, more or less the same disadvantage would be the result.</p>
	<p> If this excessive respect for antiquity has such a bad influence, how much more contagious does it become for their commentators? ‘What beauties’, says the ingenious author that we have just quoted, ‘would not be happy to inspire from their lovers the kind of vivid and tender passion that a Greek or a Roman inspire from their respective interpreters? If one says of Aristotle that he is the genius of nature; if one writes of Plato that he is the divine Plato , then one does not comment their work per se; it will always be the work of completely divine men, of men who were the admiration of their century. This is also the case with the subject that they treat: it will always be the most beautiful, the most sophisticated and the one most necessary to know. But since there have been many Descartes, Newtons, Leibnitzes and Wolfs, since we have allied Mathematics with Philosophy , our way of reasoning has been exceptionally improved.</p>
	<p> 7. The obsession with system does no less harm to the progress of truth. By obsession with system, I do not mean the approach that connects various truths to each other so to form proofs which is nothing else but the true philosophical mind – rather I mean to designate the one that makes plans and forms systems of the universe to which it then wants to adjust phenomena by will or force. One will find many good remarks on this in the second volume of L'histoire du ciel by M. the abbé Pluche. He has nonetheless taken them too far and it would be difficult for him to answer certain criticisms. It is certain that nothing is more praiseworthy than the practice adopted by the Academy of Sciences, to see, to observe, to set down in its registers observations and experiences, and to leave the desire to make a complete system for posterity when there is enough material for this; but this time is still far away, if indeed it will ever come.</p>
	<p> What thus makes the obsession with system so opposed to the progress of truth is that it is no longer possible to correct those who have imagined a system that has some appearance of verisimilitude. They preserve and very tightly hold on to everything that can serve in any way to confirm it; and, on the other hand, they do not take into consideration almost any of the objections that are opposed to it, or rather, they rid themselves of them by some frivolous distinction. They draw inner satisfaction from the sight of their work and the esteem that they hope to receive from it; they do not concentrate on anything except the image of truth that emerges from their opinions. They fixate on this image but never pay any sustained attention to the other side of their feelings, the one that would reveal its falseness to them.</p>
	<p> Add the prejudices and the passions to this. The prejudices preoccupy one part of the mind and infect the rest. The passions confuse the ideas in a million ways and they make us almost always see in objects everything that we desire to find in them: even the passion that we have for truth makes us err sometimes when it is too ardent.’</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom"[1][2][3][4]) is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.[5][6] The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation.[7][8] Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it?[9][10][11] What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?[12] Do humans have free will?[13]</p>
	<p> Historically, "philosophy" encompassed any body of knowledge.[14] From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine and physics.[15] For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize.[16][17] In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics and economics.</p>
	<p> Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective?[18][19] Are there many scientific methods or just one?[20] Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy?[21][22][23] Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics ("concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being"),[24] epistemology (about the "nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity" [25]), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy.</p>
	<p> Since the 20th century, professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors, researchers and writers. However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art and entertainment activities.[26]</p>
	<p> Introduction</p>
	<p> Knowledge</p>
	<p> Traditionally, the term "philosophy" referred to any body of knowledge.[14][27] In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton's 1687 "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used the term "natural philosophy" because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as astronomy, medicine and physics.[15]</p>
	<p> Philosophy was traditionally divided into three major branches:</p>
	<p> Natural philosophy ("physics") was the study of the physical world (physis, lit: nature);</p>
	<p> Moral philosophy ("ethics") was the study of goodness, right and wrong, beauty, justice and virtue (ethos, lit: custom);</p>
	<p> Metaphysical philosophy ("logos") was the study of existence, causation, God, logic, forms and other abstract objects ("meta-physika" lit: "what comes after physics").[28]</p>
	<p> This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and cosmology. Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.</p>
	<p> Philosophical progress</p>
	<p> Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. Colin McGinn and others claim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval.[29] Chalmers and others, by contrast, see progress in philosophy similar to that in science,[30] while Talbot Brewer argued that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.[31]</p>
	<p> Historical overview</p>
	<p> In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture and a search for knowledge. In that sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations.[32]</p>
	<p> Western philosophy</p>
	<p> Main article: Western philosophy</p>
	<p> Bust of Socrates in the Vatican Museum</p>
	<p> Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates to Pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BC such as Thales (c. 624 – c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC) who practiced a "love of wisdom" (philosophia)[33] and were also termed physiologoi (students of physis, or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom.[34] Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian European), and Modern philosophy.</p>
	<p> The Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy, and was one of the most influential Greek thinkers for the whole of Western thought.[35] Plato's student Aristotle was also extremely influential, founding the Peripatetic school. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca.</p>
	<p> Medieval philosophy (5th – 16th century) is the period following the fall of the western Roman empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of Scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance (1355–1650) period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust Humanism.</p>
	<p> Immanuel Kant.</p>
	<p> Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes (1596–1650).[36] Following the rise of natural science, Modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.[37][38][39] 19th-century philosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the Enlightenment, and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, J.S. Mill who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century saw the split between Analytic philosophy and Continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as Phenomenology, Existentialism, Logical Positivism, Pragmatism and the Linguistic turn.</p>
	<p> Middle Eastern philosophy</p>
	<p> Avicenna Portrait on Silver Vase, Iran</p>
	<p> See also: Islamic philosophy and Middle Eastern philosophy</p>
	<p> The regions of the fertile Crescent, Iran and Arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical Wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic culture. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In Ancient Egypt, these texts were known as sebayt ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophy. Babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, they both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the Tanakh) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism.</p>
	<p> Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster, one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism, Mazdakism, and Zurvanism.</p>
	<p> After the Muslim conquests, Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This Islamic Golden Age influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam which focuses on Islamic theology and Falsafa which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 – June 1037) and Averroes (12th century). Others such as Al-Ghazali were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a scientific method, experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. Ibn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history.</p>
	<p> In Iran several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and includes currents such as Illuminationist philosophy, Sufi philosophy, and Transcendent theosophy. The 19th and 20th century Arab world saw the Nahda (awakening or renaissance) movement which influenced contemporary Islamic philosophy.</p>

	<p> Main article: Indian philosophy</p>
	<p> Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: darśana; 'world views', 'teachings')[40] are philosophical traditions originating in the Indian subcontinent. Traditions of Indian philosophy are generally classified as either orthodox or heterodox – āstika or nāstika – depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and whether they accept the theories of Brahman and Atman.[41][42] The orthodox schools generally include Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta, and the common heterodox schools are Jain, Buddhist, Ajñana, Ajivika and Cārvāka. Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE). Important Indian philosophical concepts include dharma, karma, samsara, moksha and ahimsa. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, hermeneutics and soteriology. Indian philosophy also covered topics such as political philosophy as seen in the Arthashastra c. 4th century BCE and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra.</p>
	<p> The commonly named six orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the Common Era and the Gupta Empire.[43] These Hindu schools developed what has been called the "Hindu synthesis" merging orthodox Brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism as a way to respond to the unorthodox challenges.[44] Hindu thought also spread east to the Indonesian Srivijaya empire and the Cambodian Khmer Empire.</p>
	<p> Later developments include the development of Tantra and Iranian-Islamic influences. Buddhism mostly disappeared from India after the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent, surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India.[45] The early modern period saw the flourishing of Navya-Nyāya (the 'new reason') under philosophers such as Raghunatha Siromani (c.1460–1540) who founded the tradition, Jayarama Pancanana, Mahadeva Punatamakara and Yashovijaya (who formulated a Jain response).[46]</p>
	<p> The modern era saw the rise of Hindu nationalism, Hindu reform movements and Neo-Vedanta (or Hindu modernism) whose major proponents included Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Aurobindo and who for the first time promoted the idea of a unified "Hinduism". Due to the influence of British colonialism, much modern Indian philosophical work was in English and includes thinkers such as Radhakrishnan, Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, Bimal Krishna Matilal and M. Hiriyanna.[47]</p>

	<p> Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the early Buddhist texts. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. It originated in India and later spread to East Asia, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, developing new and syncretic traditions in these different regions. The various Buddhist schools of thought are the dominant philosophical tradition in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka and Burma. Because ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (dukkha), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. The ending of dukkha also encompasses meditative practices. Key innovative concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Anatta (not-self) a critique of a fixed personal identity, the transience of all things (Anicca), and a certain skepticism about metaphysical questions.</p>
	<p> Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed 'Abhidharma'. Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of Shunyata (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism. The Dignāga school of Pramāṇa promoted a complex form of epistemology and Buddhist logic. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions. The modern period saw the rise of Buddhist modernism and Humanistic Buddhism under Western influences and the development of a Western Buddhism with influences from modern psychology and Western philosophy.</p>

	<p> Kitarō Nishida, professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the Kyoto School.</p>
	<p> East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "Hundred Schools of Thought" flourished (6th century to 221 BC).[48][49] This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China, Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such Tao, Yin and yang, Ren and Li which, along with Chinese Buddhism, directly influenced Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophy (which also includes the native Shinto tradition). Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), through a gradual Silk road transmission and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/Zen) which spread throughout the East Asian cultural sphere. During later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.</p>
	<p> In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. Chinese Marxist philosophy developed under the influence of Mao Zedong, while a Chinese pragmatism under Hu Shih and New Confucianism's rise was influenced by Xiong Shili. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences (Rangaku) and the modernist Meirokusha intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The 20th century saw the rise of State Shinto and also Japanese nationalism. The Kyoto School, an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of Dogen.</p>
	<p> African philosophy</p>
	<p> Main article: African philosophy</p>
	<p> African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people, philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy, with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African.[50] During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera Yacob. Another early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo (c. 1703 – c. 1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa, the Bantu idea of 'Force', Négritude, Pan-Africanism and Ubuntu. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy, the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by African-Americans. Modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism, African-American literature, Critical theory, Critical race theory, Postcolonialism and Feminism.</p>
	<p> Indigenous American philosophy</p>
	<p> Main article: Indigenous American philosophy</p>
	<p> The Aztec Sun Stone, also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone, at National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City.</p>
	<p> Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the Indigenous people of the Americas. There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures. Among some of the Native Americans in the United States there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the "Great Mystery" (Siouan: Wakan Tanka, Algonquian: Gitche Manitou). Another widely shared concept was that of Orenda or "spiritual power". According to Peter M. Whiteley, for the Native Americans, "Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."[51] The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed Shamanism. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.[51][52]</p>
	<p> In Mesoamerica, Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini ('those who know something') [53] and its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ometeotl which can be translated as "Dual Cosmic Energy" and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of Pantheism.[54] Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli (knowledge, wisdom) which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb "the middle good is necessary".[54]</p>
	<p> The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are Yanantin and Masintin which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.[55]</p>
	<p> Categories</p>
	<p> Philosopher questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.</p>
	<p> Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.</p>
	<p> These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study.[56]</p>
	<p> Metaphysics and epistemology</p>
	<p> Value theory</p>
	<p> Science, logic and mathematics</p>
	<p> History of Western philosophy[57]</p>
	<p> Philosophical traditions</p>
	<p> These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology, or Platonic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.[58]</p>
	<p> Metaphysics</p>
	<p> Main article: Metaphysics</p>
	<p> Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, events, processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body. Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world in its entirety and ontology, the study of being.</p>
	<p> A major point of debate revolves between realism, which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism, which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity. Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to abstract objects, such as numbers, and universals, which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.</p>
	<p> Epistemology</p>
	<p> Main article: Epistemology</p>
	<p> Dignaga founded Buddhist epistemology (pramana)</p>
	<p> Epistemology is the study of knowledge (Greek episteme).[59] Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is truth? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs justified? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.</p>
	<p> Skepticism is the position which doubts claims to knowledge. The regress argument, a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can go on forever, called infinitism, it can eventually rely on basic beliefs that are left unproven, called foundationalism, or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification, called coherentism.</p>
	<p> Rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. It is associated with a priori knowledge, which is independent of experience, such as math and logical deduction. Empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.</p>
	<p> Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed are:</p>
	<p> Philosophy of language explores the nature, the origins and the use of language.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body. It is typified by disputes between dualism and materialism. In recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of religion explores questions that arise in connection with religions, including the soul, the afterlife, God, religious experience, analysis of religious vocabulary and texts and the relationship of religion and science.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of human nature analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings, such as rationality, politics and culture.</p>
	<p> Metaphilosophy explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.</p>
	<p> Value theory</p>
	<p> Value theory (or axiology) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.</p>
	<p> Ethics</p>
	<p> Main article: Ethics</p>
	<p> The Beijing imperial college was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.</p>
	<p> Ethics, or "moral philosophy", studies and considers what is good and bad conduct, right and wrong values, and good and evil. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality. It also includes meta-investigations about whether a best way to live or related standards exists. The main branches of ethics are normative ethics, meta-ethics and applied ethics.</p>
	<p> A major point of debate revolves around consequentialism, where actions are judged by the potential results of the act, such as to maximize happiness, called utilitarianism, and deontology, where actions are judged by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.</p>
	<p> Aesthetics</p>
	<p> Main article: Aesthetics</p>
	<p> Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and nature."[60][61] It addresses the nature of art, beauty and taste, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty.[62][63] It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.[64] It divides into art theory, literary theory, film theory and music theory. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic.[65] The philosophy of film analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Political philosophy</p>
	<p> Main article: Political philosophy</p>
	<p> Thomas Hobbes</p>
	<p> Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the state. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.</p>
	<p> Other branches of value theory:</p>
	<p> There are a variety of branches of value theory.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of law (often called jurisprudence) explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of education analyzes the definition and content of education, as well as the goals and challenges of educators.</p>
	<p> Feminist philosophy explores questions surrounding gender, sexuality and the body including the nature of feminism itself as a social and philosophical movement.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of sport analyzes sports, games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities.</p>
	<p> Logic, science and mathematics</p>
	<p> Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between "X" and the "philosophy of X" is debated. Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that "philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds." Curtis White, by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.[66]</p>
	<p> The topics of philosophy of science are numbers, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social sciences and natural sciences.</p>
	<p> Logic</p>
	<p> Main article: Logic</p>
	<p> Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is "a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition." The connected series of statements are "premises" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:</p>
	<p> All humans are mortal. (premise)</p>
	<p> Socrates is a human. (premise)</p>
	<p> Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)</p>
	<p> Deductive reasoning is when, given certain premises, conclusions are unavoidably implied. Rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as, modus ponens, where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.</p>
	<p> Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,[67] social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a formal science. Sub-fields include mathematical logic, philosophical logic, Modal logic, computational logic and non-classical logics. A major issue in the philosophy of mathematics revolves around whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.</p>
	<p> Philosophy of science</p>
	<p> Main article: Philosophy of science</p>
	<p> The ideas of Ibn al-Haytham were instrumental in the development of the modern Scientific method.</p>
	<p> This branch explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example, philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The philosophy of mathematics studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations and implications of mathematics.</p>
	<p> History of philosophy</p>
	<p> See also: History of ethics</p>
	<p> Further information: Philosophical progress and List of years in philosophy</p>
	<p> Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy (study of a specific period, individual or school) is related to but not the same as the philosophy of history (the theoretical aspect of history, which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity).</p>
	<p> Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of History influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history, a view called historicism.</p>
	<p> Philosophical schools</p>
	<p> Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools, such as Continental philosophy, Analytical philosophy, Thomism, Asian philosophy or African philosophy.</p>
	<p> Other approaches</p>
	<p> A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored.</p>
	<p> Applied philosophy</p>
	<p> Martin Luther King Jr</p>
	<p> The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. Weaver argued that ideas have consequences. Philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics—applied ethics in particular—and political philosophy. The political and economic philosophies of Confucius, Sun Tzu, Chanakya, Ibn Khaldun, Ibn Rushd, Ibn Taymiyyah, Machiavelli, Leibniz, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. Progressive education as championed by Dewey had a profound impact on 20th century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in philosophy for children, which are part of philosophy education. Clausewitz's political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft, international politics and military strategy in the 20th century, especially around World War II. Logic is important in mathematics, linguistics, psychology, computer science and computer engineering.</p>
	<p> Other important applications can be found in epistemology, which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence and justified belief (important in law, economics, decision theory and a number of other disciplines). The philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of B. F. Skinner's behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. Deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. Aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music, literature, the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.</p>
	<p> Society</p>
	<p> Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as professors who teach, research and write in academic institutions.[68] However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.[26][69] For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians Steve Martin and Ricky Gervais, filmmaker Terrence Malick, Pope John Paul II, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer and vice presidential candidate Carly Fiorina.[70][71]</p>
	<p> Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar Berggruen Prize, first awarded to Charles Taylor in 2016.[72]</p>
	<p> Professional</p>
	<p> Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. At the end of 1817, Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.</p>
	<p> Bertrand Russell</p>
	<p> Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: "Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."[73] Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.[74]</p>
	<p> The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher Michael Sandel's book Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do? and Harry Frankfurt's On Bullshit are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became 'New York Times best sellers.</p>
	<p> Non-professional</p>
	<p> Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as scientists, social scientists, and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.</p>
	<p> Ayn Rand is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of "philosophy": "For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact."[15]</p>
	<p> Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as Gerd B. Achenbach (Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen Praxis, 1983) and Michel Weber (see his Épreuve de la philosophie, 2008) who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.</p>
	<p> Pierre Hadot is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. Hadot identified and analyzed the "spiritual exercises" used in ancient philosophy (influencing Michel Foucault's interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his History of Sexuality). By "spiritual exercises" Hadot means "practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.[6] The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within."[7] Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings. Hadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in What Is Ancient Philosophy?,[7] which has been critically reviewed.[8]</p>
	<p> Role of women</p>
	<p> Main article: Women in philosophy</p>
	<p> American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art Susanne Langer (1895–1985).</p>
	<p> Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women have engaged in philosophy throughout history. Women philosophers have contributed since ancient times–notably Hipparchia of Maroneia (active ca. 325 BC) and Arete of Cyrene (active 5th–4th century BC). More were accepted during the ancient, medieval and modern eras, but no women philosophers became part the Western canon until the 20th and 21st century, when some sources indicate that Susanne Langer, Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir entered the canon.[75][76]</p>
	<p> In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women, producing more female academics. Nevertheless, U.S. Department of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities.[77] In 2014, Inside Higher Education described the philosophy "...discipline's own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment" of women students and professors.[78]University of Sheffield philosophy professor Jennifer Saul stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." [79]</p>
	<p> In the early 1990s, the Canadian Philosophical Association noted a gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy.[80] In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total."[81] Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."[82] According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest). While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."[83]</p>
	<p> Popular culture</p>
	<p> In 2000, the Open Court Publishing Company began publishing a series of books on philosophy and popular culture. Each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers. The books "explore the meanings, concepts and puzzles within television shows, movies, music and other icons of popular culture"[84] analyzing topics such as the TV shows Seinfeld and The Simpsons, The Matrix and Star Wars movies and related media and new technological developments such as the iPod and Facebook. Their most recent publication (as of 2016) is titled Louis C.K. and Philosophy; its subject is the comedian Louis C.K..</p>
	<p> The Matrix makes numerous references to philosophy including Buddhism, Vedanta, Advaita Hinduism, Christianity, Messianism, Judaism, Gnosticism, existentialism and nihilism. The film's premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the cave, Descartes's evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the Ding an sich, Zhuangzi's "Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly", Marxist social theory and the brain in a vat thought experiment. Many references to Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation appear in the film, although Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation.[85]</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Portugal, in Latin, Lusitania, the westernmost kingdom in Europe, bordered on the north by Galicia, on the south and west by the ocean, to the east by Andalusia, New Castile, and the Kingdom of Leon. Its surface extends from north to south. It is 120 leagues in length and 50 in width.</p>
	<p> Portugal’s weather is rather temperate, pure, and healthy. It is a very good country. It does not lack grains, its fruits are exquisite, its oils delicious. One finds much honey, woolens are admirable, salt works abundant, farm animals and horses very esteemed. Portugal ’s oranges and wines, especially those from Alentejo and from the Algarves, are sought after.</p>
	<p> There are mines of gold and silver, quarries of fine marble, precious stones, rubies, emeralds, amethysts.</p>
	<p> A great number of rivers furnish water. The principal ones are the Tagus, the Guadiana, the Douro, etc. The Catholic religion is the only one allowed. There are many Jews, but they are hidden. The Inquisition is very severe there. There are three archdioceses and ten bishoprics, without counting those in Africa and Asia.</p>
	<p> Portugal is divided into six parts: the kingdom of the Algarves, the provinces between Douro-e-Minho, Beira, Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes, and Portuguese Estremadura. In addition the Kingdom of Portugal has considerable possessions in America, such as Brazil, in Africa, and in Asia.</p>
	<p> The Portuguese language is composed of Latin, French, and Castilian. It is serious and elegant. Since it is not lacking in elevation for heroic subjects, likewise it is filled with sweetness for the delicate expressions of love.</p>
	<p> Lisbon is the capital of the kingdom, longitude 9.12, latitude 37.42.</p>
	<p> The Kingdom of Portugal is the Lusitania of the ancients; however, Lusitania was comprised of regions that today are not part of Portugal, and Portugal contains some regions that were not part of Lusitania. Its first inhabitants formed several republics and governed themselves according to their laws and customs.</p>
	<p> When the Phoenicians reached the coasts of Lusitania they fortified the island of Cadiz whence they spread onto the continent where they made conquests aided by the Carthaginians around 510 B.C. This country was next conquered by the Romans, and then in succession by the Vandals, Goths and Moors.</p>
	<p> Afonso VI, King of Castile and Leon, conquered the greater part of Lusitania from the Moors in 1094. He married his legitimated daughter, Teresa of Castile, to Henry of Burgundy, and gave to him as dowry the city of Porto with the title of Count of Portugal.</p>
	<p> Henriques conquered much of the country from the Moors, founded in proper manner the Kingdom of Portugal, and was crowned in 1139 following the famous battle of Ourique. Pope Alexander III required from him a tribute of two gold marks to confirm the crown; the King paid that amount since he knew that in quarrels among sovereigns, the pope, when paid a tidy sum, could sometimes tip the balance of the scales.</p>
	<p> This new kingdom maintained itself gloriously, and in the fifteenth century by the fruit of their discoveries the Portuguese changed world commerce and began to merit a glory as durable as the universe. It was the first among modern nations to sail on the Atlantic Ocean. It was due to her alone that the passage of the Cape of Good Hope was discovered, while the Spaniards owed to foreigners the discovery of America.</p>
	<p> Portugal remained occupied by its great voyages and its successes in Africa and did not take part in the events in Italy that alarmed the rest of Europe.</p>
	<p> From the time of Afonso I, who was nicknamed Henriques, this kingdom existed four hundred and forty-nine years under sixteen kings, ending in 1578 with the tragic death of the unfortunate Dom Sebastião who perished in Africa in a battle against the Moors. Nevertheless one could say that the kingdom only ended in 1580 Enrique II, despite being a priest and a cardinal, was recognized King of Portugal, following the death of his nephew, Sebastião.</p>
	<p> Philip II of Spain, finding himself better situated than other claimants to the crown of Portugal, seized the realm and united it to the Spanish monarchy in 1580. He was the first since the Gothic kings to have the glory to see Spain under his dominion after having been divided nearly eight hundred years. The successors to Philip II retained it in the same state until 1640 when the Portuguese, in a general uprising, shook off the yoke of the Castilian kings. </p>
	<p> “A conspiracy carried out as well as it was led,” says Voltaire, “placed the house of Bragança on the throne.”  João de Bragança was everywhere proclaimed king without any protests;  a son does not more peacefully succeed his father. The manner by which Olivares announced to Philip IV the loss of Portugal is famous.  No other example could better serve the purpose to illustrate how contrary news is disguised for kings. “I have come to announce to you,” said he, “a fortunate piece of news; your majesty has gained all the Duke of Bragança’s goods. He proclaimed himself king, and the confiscation of his lands will be acquired for you due to his crime.”</p>
	<p> This confiscation did not take place and Portugal became a considerable kingdom, especially when the riches of Brazil and treaties with England caused her commerce to flourish. José de Bragança, great-grand-son of João, is today on the throne.  Recently he barely escaped the loss of his life and crown in an attempted assassination. </p>
	<p> The crown is hereditary, and may pass to bastards when there are no legitimate children.</p>
	<p> Several writers have given the antiquities, the history and the description of Portugal. Such writers are Gaspard Estazo, Antiquités de Portugal ;  António Vasconcelos, anaceh. Reg. Lusitan; Jerôme Conertaggio, Edouard de Nugnez, Texeira, histoire de Portugal ;  Imhoff, s temma regum Lusitan ; Maugin, description du Portugal ; Lequien de la Neuville, histoire de Portugal, 2 vol. in -4 ; Vertot, révolutions de Portugal.  Finally, the cavaleiro de Oliveira has discussed the historians and the writers of this kingdom in some memoires concerning Portugal, published in The Hague in 1743, in-12.</p>`,

	eArt: `<p> Type for printing consists of many little prisms made of a certain metal, at the end of [each of] which there is, in relief, a letter or some other character used in the printing of books. The surface of these characters, which, carrying a film of ink – black red or of some other colour – and pressed firmly by the printing press on to prepared paper leaves its impression there. See Ink, Printing, Printing press.</p>
	<p> It is apparent that the character that is to leave its imprint on the paper must be the mirror image of its imprint. For example , in order that the character B should give the imprint B the character must have this form : </p>
	<p> since, if one imagines a piece of paper applied to this shape so that it receives its image, it is evident that when the paper is turned over to view the imprint the left side will now be on the right and the right side on the left and one will see not </p>
	<p> but B. It is as though one looked from behind at the character printed on transparent paper. That is why reading a [printer’s] forme is difficult for those who are not accustomed to it. See Printing, Forme.</p>
	<p> One may imagine that, if one were to have as many of these little characters in relief as could be found in writing and if one possessed the means of arranging them in the required order to represent writing and of coating them with some colouring material then applying them to paper so that the paper received only the images of the imposed characters, one would be in possession of the most desirable of all arts, that of multiplying at little cost and in an infinite numbers of copies all those good books for which this art ought to be reserved; for it would appear that, since the art of Printing puts the fruits of the human spirit into the hands of everyone, only those books should be printed whose reading can damage no one.</p>
	<p> This art [pre]supposes the arts of making the characters and of using them : the art of making them divides into two others, that of making the punches needed to cast the characters and that of casting them using the punches  [1].</p>
	<p> The art of printing may thus be divided into three : first, cutting the punches  [2], secondly, typefounding  [3], and thirdly the use of the type which has been cast, for which we reserve the name printing .</p>
	<p> Here we shall describe the methods of cutting the punches and of casting type [typefounding]. As for their use, that will be found in the article Printing together with a detailed history of the whole art.</p>
	<p> Punch cutting . One may regard the punchcutters as the original creators of all the moveable type  [4] with which printing has been carried out since its beginning. It is they who invented moveable type, improved it and brought it to perfection by long and painstaking stages until it reached the state in which we now see it.</p>
	<p> Before the invention of printing, text was cut on a wooden block with one block corresponding to each page or to a single sheet; but the difficulty of correcting the errors that slipped into the blocks and the encumbrance of these blocks which multiplied to infinity gave rise to the idea of making the characters moveable and of having as many pieces as there are distinct signs used in writing  [5].</p>
	<p> This discovery was made in Germany about 1440 and was found so useful that its success was very rapid. Several individuals were involved simultaneously in improving it, some of them cooperating with the inventor, others, it is claimed, stealing part of the secret to form their own association, and enriching the infant art by their own experiments to the extent that we do not know who was the true inventor of the admirable art of cutting punches and casting type since several people were involved more or less at the same time. However, this honour is most commonly attributed to John Guttemberg, a German gentleman  [6]. See the article Printing.</p>
	<p> The punchcutters are little known in the republic of Letters. Unjustly, - there are glaring examples of this - reputations have been attributed to those printers who produced the finest editions which should at least have been shared with their skilled workmen who cut the punches from which the type was cast  [7]. Without the difficult art of typefounding  [8] it would be as though one were to attribute the renown of a good engraving to the copperplate printer who bought the plate and sold the images that he had printed from it to the public.</p>
	<p> Much has been said of the Plantins, the Elzevirs, the Estiennes and other printers celebrated for the beauty and clarity of their types without noticing that they were not the types’ creators and, to speak exactly, only showed off the work of others for all that they added value to it by their sophisticated and clean impressions  [9].</p>
	<p> We do not intend here to denigrate the art properly called Typography : it has its rules that are not always easy to observe correctly and its difficulties can be overcome only by long experience of working on it. This work divides into several branches each of which demands a particular skill. But is the praise which he attracts for the mechanics of composition, the cleanness of impression, the accuracy of correction, not sufficient without transferring to him also that due to men left in obscurity although one owes to them all that is finest in printing? For it is an astonishing fact that those authors who have written histories of printing at various times, who have followed its progress and shown themselves the most learned on this subject, have dilated greatly on the merits of the printers almost without saying a word about the cutters of characters though the printer, or, rather, typography is only to the punchcutter what a skilled singer is to a good musical composer.</p>
	<p> It is so that these artists should have the recognition that they deserve that M Fournier the younger who is, himself, a skilled punchcutter and typefounder in Paris, has discussed them in his book of models of type faces published in 1742. He has included in those who were distinguished in the art Simon de Colines born in the village of Gentilly near Paris, who in 1480  [10], cut roman faces similar to those we have today. Aldus Manutius did the same in Venice at the same time. In 1510, Claude Garamond, a native of Paris, carried this work to the highest level of perfection that it has ever reached, both in the shape of the characters and in the quality and precision of their execution.</p>
	<p> Near the beginning of the present century some letters were improved but the exactness and uniformity introduced by Garamond into punch cutting was not surpassed. It was Garamond who, at the command of François I, introduced the face that brought so much renown to Robert Estienne  [11]. Robert Granjean, also a Parisian, son of Jean Granjean printer and bookseller, cut very fine Greek and Latin [roman] type and particularly excelled with his italic faces. He moved to Lyon in 1570 and worked there for eight years after which he went to Rome at the invitation of Pope Gregory XIII.</p>
	<p> The faces of this cutter [Granjean] have been more praised than those of any of his contemporaries ; they were similar in style but more refined. The strikes or matrices were distributed across Europe and are still used in many places  [12].</p>
	<p> The taste for his italics began to wane about the beginning of the eighteenth century : this typographic revolution, so to speak, was led by MM Granjean and Alexandre, punchcutters to the king, whose faces are used in the Imprimerie royale. In 1742 M Fournier the younger, whom we have quoted with much approval, brought them [italics] closer to our style of writing by the form and the shapes of the solid and white areas that he applied to them. See the article Italic [13].</p>
	<p> Guillaume le Bé, born in Troyes in the Champagne about the year 1525, cut several faces and worked particularly on Hebrew and Rabbinical characters. He worked first in Paris from where he went to Venice, Rome etc. then returned to Paris where he died. Robert Estienne made frequent use of his faces in his Hebrew editions.</p>
	<p> Jacques de Sanlecque, born in Cauleu in the district of Boulogne in Picardy, began in early youth to practise punchcutting. He worked around 1558 and was very successful.</p>
	<p> His son, [also] Jacques de Sanlecque, born in Paris, began with literary studies in which he made good progress and he became a worthy successor to his father as a punch cutter. In 1614 the Senlecques, father and son, were the only punchcutters in Paris. The son cut some very fine type for Plainchant and music and some fine typefaces among which are included the smallest there was in Paris, which we call Parisienne. See Parisienne.</p>
	<p> M. Fournier the younger, a most reliable authority because of his competence in his craft and knowledge of its history, makes the severe judgment that, from the time after the younger Senlecques until the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was no French punchcutter worthy of the name.</p>
	<p> With regard to making the distinction between i and u as consonants and as vowels, there was not a single punchcutter able to cut acceptable punches; the old punches that are found from time to time demonstrate how much the craft had degenerated. This happens with all arts whenever those who practise them are but rarely employed. Equestrian statues are only rarely cast; punches for type-casting last almost for ever, thus it must follow that the ways of going about the manufacture of such things, and excelling therein, become largely forgotten.</p>
	<p> The cutting of letter-punches is the secret of printing; it was this art that had to be invented for it to be possible to produce infinite numbers of letters and thus to make it possible for printing to produce as many compositions as a language has words, or as the imagination can conceive ideas, and as many as the symbols that Man can invent to express them.</p>
	<p> The character is cut in relief on one end of a piece of steel about two inches long and of a thickness proportional to the design that is to be formed on it. It must be cut with the greatest possible perfection according to the principles of Art and the proportions of each letter; for it is on the perfection of the punch that depends the perfection of the type to which it gives rise.</p>
	<p> Punches are made from the best steel available. One begins by establishing the form of the letter: this is a matter of taste and we have seen over time how letters vary – not in their essential shape but in the mutual inter-relationships of the components of the form. Take the design of the capital B that we took as an example; this letter is made up of white regions and black regions; the first are hollow and the latter are raised.</p>
	<p> To produce the hollow areas one makes a counter-punch in the shape of the white areas See Plate III of typefounding, fig 52 [14] which is the counter-punch for the letter B . When the counter-punch has been smoothed well and tempered to hardness then annealed a little so that it will not fracture, it is ready for use.</p>
	<p> With the counter-punch ready, the punch must next be made. To do this good steel is taken and a piece of suitable size is prepared and brought to red heat in the fire to soften it then cut into pieces of the length we have described. One end, which will become the top, is rounded and the other end is carefully filed so that its face is exactly perpendicular to the [long] axis of the punch. This is achieved by putting it in the square  [15] and rubbing it on the oilstone, as will be explained later. Care must be taken to smooth two of the long faces of the punch which are to be placed against the internal edges of the square. A reference mark is made on one of these faces, which serves two purposes 1, to mark the top or the bottom [side] of the letter, according to which face is marked; 2, to ensure that the same faces are set against the square each time as were used the first time. This precaution is absolutely essential; without it one could never have a satisfactory little face on which to cut the letter  [16].</p>
	<p> When the punch has been prepared as just described, if it is large it is made red hot, if it is not [large] it suffices just to reheat it, to receive the impression of the counter-punch. It is clamped up in a vice with a suitable opening  [17]. It [the hot punch blank] is secured [in the vice] by two screws with the face perpendicular to the axis at the top. The counter-punch is presented to the face and driven in to the body of the punch blank to a depth of about one line by a blow of the hammer so that it receives the imprint of the hollow areas of the letter.</p>
	<p> The counter-punch is then removed and the punch taken out of the vice and filed both on the face perpendicular to the axis [which now carries the impression of the counter-punch] and on the lateral faces, then it is dressed on the stone using the square. Some punchcutters trace around the outer contours of the masses forming the parts of the letter in relief using a very sharp steel point, but, if the counter-punch has been well cut the workman can just by guided by the shape [of the counter-punch’s impression]. The metal outside the tracing - if one has been drawn - is removed with the file; a tracing is always used in the cutting of type ornaments  [18]. Care must be taken not to spoil the contours of the letter by removing too much metal. Next, the letter is smoothed on the oilstone to remove the burr that is left by the file, then the letter is finished with the file or sometimes with a graver [19] so that, on the end of the punch, only the letter is left as is seen for the letter B in figs.3 and 4 of the same plate [20]. These figures show the finished punch; it can be seen that the excess metal has been removed leaving a slope from the letter down to the shank  [21] .</p>
	<p> The dressing square [jig] seen in figs. 6 (lower) and 7 [22] is a piece of wood or copper formed by two rectangular blocks DB, BF that enclose a right angle at B  [23] so that the line descending from B to the stone is perpendicular to the horizontal. The bottom faces of the square, which rest on the stone, are shod with steel or some other metal that has been smoothed perfectly flat on the oilstone, which must itself have a perfectly flat and level surface. The punch is placed in the angle of the square and held in place by the thumb then, with the rest of the hand which holds the sides of the square, the whole assembly is slid across the oilstone which has been spread with a little olive oil. The stone grinds both the sole of the square and the face of the punch. Since the punch remains in contact with the angle of the square at B and, because the wide surface of the square ensures that its walls remain vertical, this ensures that the punch also is kept orthogonal to the stone and thus that the plane of the [face of] the letter is perfectly perpendicular to the [long] axis of the punch.</p>
	<p> Once the punch has been dressed it is tempered to harden it. Then it is annealed a little so that it does not fracture when it is used to stamp the matrices; on its solid structure depends its durability and its quality. If it is too hard it will break easily, too soft and the angles of the letter will be blurred and it will have to be re-cut and filed.</p>
	<p> All the punches for one body [size] must be the same height measured from the face. All the capitals must be of equal size and the ascenders of the lower-case letter s b, d, l etc . and others that have them, and the descenders of p and q must be of equal length. The small letter must also be of equal height among themselves but shorter than [the letters with ascenders or descenders], for example, m, a etc .  [24] The letters sizes are checked with a gauge which is a flat piece of lead with three recesses, the first for the largest letters such as the long j , capital Q etc. the second for long letters such as capitals and lower-case letters with ascenders or descenders like d, b, p, q, and the third for the other lower-case letters such as m, a, c, e . The letter on the punch when presented to the gauge must fill the appropriate recess exactly so that when the letters are cast their tops and bases will be exactly aligned as can be</p>
	<p> seen in this example :</p>
	<p> etc. etc.</p>
	<p> When the punches are finished they are passed to the Caster who must make certain that the punches he has bought or made have the [letter] face well finished and of sufficient depth and that the bases and tops of the letters fit properly between parallel lines. The letter M is usually dealt with first and acts as a guide for the other letters.</p>
	<p> The casting of type . Casting of the type follows the cutting of the punches. The term Typefounding has several meanings  [25]: it can mean either a complete set of punches, matrices and letters, signs, figures etc. used in printing together with the moulds, furnaces and other tools needed for the casting of letters. It can also refer to the workshop where type is cast or to the place where the metal for type is prepared, or, finally, it may refer to the technique of casting type and it is in this last sense that we are going to treat of it here.</p>
	<p> Typefounding is a free craft. Its practitioners are not subject to masters, conditions of admission  [26] or inspection. Nevertheless, they the enjoy privileges, exceptions and immunities allowed to printers and are regarded as part of the printing fraternity.</p>
	<p> The art is not well known since the vulgar make no point of distinction between Typefounding and printing and regard print as the creation of the printer in the way that a picture is the work of a Painter. There are few places in which the art is practised; there are scarcely a dozen type foundries in France and, of that dozen, more than half are in Paris.</p>
	<p> The first Typefounders were punch-cutters, casters of type and printers. That is, the people who made the punches struck the matrices and cast the type  [27] from them, set up the type in formes and printed from it. But the art was divided into three parts because it was difficult [for one person] to practise all of them equally successfully.</p>
	<p> One may make the same observation of those who only cast type as of those who only print, that both of them make images, the one group in metal, the other on paper. Whether the letters are agreeable or ugly they are neither to be praised or blamed; both contribute to the quality of the edition, the Printers through the composing [of the type] and the printing, the Typefounders by their pains to ensure that the letters are cast precisely according to the requirements of the Art; that is to say that all the letters of each body [size] are of equal height  [28] and height-to-paper, that all their shapes are properly aligned and equally spaced, that all the roman letters are upright and completely vertical, that the italics are of uniform inclination and similarly for other letters according to their characteristics: we shall deal with all these matters in detail.</p>
	<p> Once the Typefounder has procured the best punches his first task is to prepare the matrices. He takes the best copper  [29] available and files from it little lozenges between fifteen and twenty-eight lines long and of a width and thickness appropriate for the letter at the size to be cast. These copper pieces, smoothed and annealed  [30], are placed one at a time on a little anvil and the engraved end of a punch is applied to a suitable place [on the copper blank] then with one or more blows from the hammer the punch is drive in to a predetermined depth of between half-a-line and a line-and-a-half.</p>
	<p> In this process, the copper accepts the exact shape of the [letter on the] punch and becomes, in effect, a mould for the body of letters  [31] the same as that on the punch; for this reason it [the stamped copper] is called a matrix . The word mould , on the other hand, is reserved for a whole assembly of which the matrix is only the most important part.</p>
	<p> But the newly-struck matrix is imperfect with respect to the shape of which it carries the imprint. The upper face which carries the stamp of the punch must be exactly parallel to the [shape of the] letter stamped on it and the lateral faces must be absolutely perpendicular to the upper face. fig. 1.3. de la Fonderie en caracteres, Planche [32] The first condition is brought about by filing away the metal of the matrix that projects beyond the plane parallel to the letter face and the second is fulfilled using the file and the square [to file the sides].</p>
	<p> This done, the recesses a, b, c visible in figs. 12 and 13 are used. The two recesses a, b one on the upper surface, the other on the lower, (fig 13) at the same level, serve to fix the matrix to the mould. The third recess, c receives the end of the arc or archet [a spring] which pushes the matrix against the mould, as we shall explain.</p>
	<p> The mould  [33] is an assembly built of many parts of which one can consider the total to be divided in two  [34].</p>
	<p> All the parts of each half of the mould are held in contact with each other [the halves of the mould are pushed together by] by nuts and bolts; the parts are all well smoothed and polished metal except for the two outermost pieces which are of wood and so have the name the woods of the mould  [35] . This [wooden] covering protects the hands of the workman from the heat that is transmitted to the mould by the molten metal which is repeatedly poured into it.</p>
	<p> The first two parts of the mould to be considered are those seen in figs 20 and 21 of Plate III of typefounding .Figure 20 shows the platen seen from inside and fitted with all its component parts: in Figure 21 is the same – or a similar – platen seen from the opposite side. To the platens are attached all the other components and it serves as their support as is apparent [from the figures]. The first component to be added to the platen is B, figs. 1. 2. 3. 17. 20., called the longue piece [long piece] since it and its partner are, in fact, the longest components of the mould. (Note that a given component carries the same identifying letters in the different figures). This long piece is ten lines in width and is as thick as desired; it is forked at one end X figs. 17. and 18  [36] and thus receives the head of the potence  [37] of the other half [of the mould] for which it acts as a slide. It must be kept in mind that the two halves of the mould are similar in most respects and that all the parts we have described and are about to describe are double [i.e. paired] with one in each half of the mould.</p>
	<p> The long piece is fixed to the platen by a round-headed screw b, fig 18 which, after passing through the hole b, fig. 21  [38] screws into the tapped hole in the long piece level with the fork X  [39]. This tapped hole does not penetrate right through  [40] the long piece at the end of which is a square hole dfigs. 17 and 18 which receives the square tenon  [41] of the potence, figs. 9 and 10 .</p>
	<p> Before the potence D is put in place one of the blancs C is applied; figs. 14 and 15 show the blanc assembled with the potence. These blancs are the same width as the long pieces. They are a little less that half the length of the long piece</p>
	<p> and the same thickness as the body of the type to be cast in the mould.</p>
	<p> The blanc attached to the long piece, as fig. 20 shows, is pierced by a square hole similar to that shown in fig 7 . This hole receives the square tenon X of the potence, figs. 9 and 10.  [42] The tenon passes through the blanc and the platine and fixes these parts together. The end D of the potence projects on the side nearest to the long piece. The end m is threaded and carries a nut which is marked d in fig. 21  [43].</p>
	<p> The nuts, which are facetted, are turned with the nut-spanner shown in fig. 26  [44].</p>
	<p> The blanc may also be attached to the platen by a screw with no visible head which goes through the platen; its shaft is screwed into the wall of the blanc where it ends; however this [type of fixing] is no longer in use.</p>
	<p> On top of the long pieces are placed the jets A, figs. 5 and 6  [45] seen in fig. e o  [46]. These jets form two halves of a pyramidal funnel whose external faces are perpendicular to each other. These faces that abut on the platen, the blanc and the long piece, must fit exactly against them. When the two parts of the mould are fitted together it is clear that the jets from a chute with the smaller opening to the bottom. The sloping faces, A, fig. 20 must pass a little beyond the surfaces of the long piece and the blanc, to restrain the path of the molten metal that will be poured into the mould. At the same time they determine the boundary where the excess metal will be broken off from the cast type, and make this fracture easier. See figures 2. 3. 20  [47] where the projection of the inclined faces of the jets is clearly visible.</p>
	<p> Each jet carries a screw visible in fig. 6  [48] which, with a nut, fixes it to the platen as is seen in a fig. 21  [49]. The part of the shaft of this screw within the plate of the platen is square and passes through a hole of the same shape; the prevents the jet from rocking as also does the firm contact of one of the faces of the jet with the platen and the other face which rests against the long piece and the blanc.</p>
	<p> Below the square hole d in the long piece there is a screw f attached to a dovetail in the long piece  [50]. A nut F, fig 20 on this screw attaches the piece E, fig. 19  [51] called the register. The part of the screw, or screwed tenon, f that fits into the register is square and goes into a socket that is longer than it is wide; this allows the register to be moved out or in as desired.</p>
	<p> Each platen has, on its back, a screw G as seen in figure 21 ; this screw passes through a wooden plate, the wood of the mould , which is the same shape and size as the platen to the back of which it is held by a nut. To make the platen and the wood fit together precisely the wood has cavities excavated in it to accommodate the screws, nuts and other projecting parts that are visible on the back of the platen in fig. 21 .</p>
	<p> The two halves of the mould, built as we have just described and seen [separately] in figs. 1 and 2 fit together exactly to form a whole as shown in fig. 1  [52].</p>
	<p> The potence of one [half] fits into the forked recess in the long piece of the other side and, since the recesses point in the same direction as the potences, they both serve as slides and thus the two blancs are able to move back and forward in relation to each other when one half of the mould is moved over the other.</p>
	<p> It is also clear that the space between the jets forms a truncated pyramid with the part which is between the long pieces and the blancs forming a quadrangular prism about ten lines high and of constant thickness. The separation of the blancs is adjustable by moving them together or apart by the action of the registers that are moved back or forward as required, as we have explained. The spaces within the jet and the prism communicate and, in effect, form a single cavity.</p>
	<p> This, then, is the assembly of the parts; however, the mould is not yet complete and still lacks its essential component, the reason for the devising and arranging of all the other components, that is, the matrix . The matrix is fixed between the two registers in M as is shown in fig. 2  [53], one end rests against the platen of the other side and the other end is fixed to the attache . The attache is a little piece of sheepskin glued to one of the woods of the mould which passes between the jimblet and the wood. The name jimblet is applied to a little piece of iron driven into the wood of the lower half of the mould that, by restraining the attache, prevents the matrix from moving out of place  [54].</p>
	<p> The matrix is held in place between the registers and against the long pieces and the blancs by the spring D C E, fig. 1 which is called the arc or archet. The end E of the spring fits into the recess C of the matrix figs. 12, 13 and acts to push the matrix against the opposite platen and the heurtoir, the part shown in fig 22 . This part [heurtoir] is placed against that visible at m in fig. 21  [55] riveted to the back of the platen; it acts to raise or lower the matrix from the main part of the mould as required and [so] to adjust the position of the letter on the body of the type; to carry out this adjustment [heurtoirs] of various thicknesses are used.</p>
	<p> To prevent the matrix from falling out from between the registers a little hook is put between the platen and the wood holding the attache as shown in fig. 23 ; this hook is called the jobet. The ring of the jobet is threaded over the projecting screw G of the platen, fig. 21  [56]; its hook passes under the matrix and supports it but without getting in its way, as can be seen in x fig. 2  [57].</p>
	<p> In addition to the components we have just described, each half of the mould carries a hook a b, figs. 1. 2. 3. whose purpose will be explained later.</p>
	<p> Before the mould is closed a half-cylinder should be noted, as shown in fig. 17 , a b , on the upper part of the long piece, placed about two lines below its upper surface. This half-cylinder, the cran , is a locating piece with its exposed face rounded, running along the long piece. But since this raised portion would prevent the blanc of the other side from making complete contact with the one carrying the ridge, the opposing blanc has an appropriately-sized cavity excavated in it. The hemi-cylindrical cavity receives the hemi-cylindrical ridge. The cavity is shown in b a fig. 15 .</p>
	<p> That completes the description of the structure of the mould, one of the most ingenious devices that could be imagined as will be borne out by what we are about to say about [the process of] casting [type].</p>
	<p> The mould is made up of twelve principal components as has been described. All the parts are of well-smoothed iron, fitted together exactly, and together they form a whole from two to four inches long, according to the size of the type, by about two inches wide and containing within its horizontal dimension at least forty separate parts. The two parts into which the mould is divided are called respectively the upper and the lower parts . The one with the archet is the lower part.</p>
	<p> Once the mould has been built and made ready the next operation is the preparation of the material from which the type will be cast. To do this, lead and regulus of antimony  [58] are taken and melted separately; then the molten material is mixed in the proportion of four parts of lead to one part of antimony which gives a mixture suitable for type casting.</p>
	<p> Alternatively , take crude antimony, an equal quantity of potin  [59] and mix with molten lead and you will have another alloy.</p>
	<p> The former alloy is preferable to the latter which it seems has been abandoned in France for the last twenty years because it was found that potin and antimony  [60] produced a great deal of slag which made the alloy pasty and requiring much more heat [to liquefy it].</p>
	<p> Thus, we can say that, in general, type is cast from a mixture of lead and regulus of antimony, in which the latter corrects the softness of the former.</p>
	<p> The metal is melted in a furnace similar to that shown in the picture [at the tope of] the first Plate of typefounding; it is divided into two parts, both built of brick. That in fig. 4 is a furnace on which is placed a cast-iron cauldron in which is molten lead. This cauldron is heated by a wood fire, as can be seen, and the smoke escapes by an opening at the back and is carried into a chimney common to both furnaces.</p>
	<p> The second furnace, fig. 3 of the same image, is a proper furnace; its upper part is the opening of the fire chamber, the lower part is the ash box; these two pars are separated by a horizontal grate. The grate supports a crucible containing the regulus of antimony and the hot charcoal which melts it. The fire is blown by the draught through the grate. The workers who tend the furnace are advised to avoid the fumes from the regulus which are believed to be poisonous: but this is just prejudice, the use of regulus does not expose the Founders to any particular disease. The fumes are not deadly - particularly to cats: the first time they are exposed to them [the fumes] they are affected by such strange vertigo that, after being tormented by them for some time in the room in which they were forced to inhale them they throw themselves out of the windows; I have seen this experiment twice in the course of a single day. But, having escaped, and the first exposure not having been fatal, they enter the fumes that affected them so violently on first exposure and live quite happily in foundries.</p>
	<p> The molten regulus in the crucible is poured into the lead in the cauldron in the required amount. The workman 4 [i.e. in fig. 4] ladles out the mixture and pours it into moulds or pottery vessels at his feet. On the floor can also be seen the tongs for the crucible, its lid, a ladle and other tools used in the foundry  [61].</p>
	<p> The proportions of antimony and lead [in the metal] are not the same for all kinds of type: since the action of antimony is to give body to the lead [harden it] more or less of it is added according to the size of the type. Since smaller type sizes are less resistant to the action of the press than larger ones, they are cast from metal that the workers call strong and the larger ones from weak metal  [62].</p>
	<p> When the metal or alloy has been prepared thus and cast into ingots it goes to the Founders’ furnace. See the furnaces in the picture, fig. 2 and 2 at the right and left  [63].</p>
	<p> The furnace is made of the [type of] clay used by furnace-makers for crucibles, but less fine; it is made from powdered broken pots ground up and china clay, beaten together with water. The furnace is some eighteen to twenty inches high, ten to twelve inches in diameter and two and a half feet long; it is divided horizontally by a grate made either of iron or pottery. The wood is placed on top of the grate, the lower chamber D is the ash box  [64]; the upper part has a round opening B about six inches in diameter surrounded by a sort of circlet that supports the iron vessel A fig. 9, called the furnace ladle  [65]. This furnace ladle is divided into two or three portions as can be seen [in fig. 9]; these divisions hold metal of different strengths or qualities, according to the [needs of] the workers using it, and each workman dips into  [66] the division holding the metal of the composition that he needs.</p>
	<p> The furnace also has another opening H to which is fitted a pottery pipe that carries the fumes out of the workshop, as can be seen in the image [top of Plate I]. The whole furnace is supported by a table F G G G with a shelf F at half its height which serves to hold various tools [fig. 10].</p>
	<p> Beside the furnace several benches are placed as can be seen in the image and, below, in the Plan fig. 11 ; these are sorts of tables with their top at working-height; they are surrounded by an upstand and must be two or three inches lower than the top of the furnace and have one end placed close to it as shown in the image [Plate I, top]. A plate of pottery or iron is arranged with one end resting on the furnace and the other on the table. This plate serves to collect the drops of molten metal that fall from the casting ladle or that the workman shakes out of the mould when it is overfilled.</p>
	<p> When the workman is ready to cast a letter, he takes the mould, prepared as we have described and as shown in fig. 1 in his left hand; he puts the end of the arc or archet in the recess that we have explained is in the lower part of the mould so that it bears exactly against the long pieces and the projecting parts of the blancs. He then pushes the two halves of the mould so that the registers are well placed against the lateral surfaces of the matrix and he lutes the bottom of the jet lightly with a little ochre dispersed in cold water, if the letter is very thin. This lute makes the metal flow freely and directs it into the bottom of the hollow pyramid before it has time to cool and solidify through contact with the surfaces of the components that form the walls of this space. The same method is used with the moule à reglet of which we shall speak below. Since the metal in this mould is often thicker and has a long distance to flow it is even more likely to solidify and not reach the bottom of the mould so, in this case, the whole of the inside surface of the mould is coated with ochre and not just the jet, using the thinnest coat possible; but let us return now to the casting of letters .</p>
	<p> When everything is ready, the Founder takes up in the casting ladle shown in fig. 13 a quantity of molten metal and throws it into the sort of funnel that we have explained is formed by the jets. The liquid metal descends into the hollow prism between the surfaces of the long pieces and the blancs and spreads out over the surface of the matrix filling all its contours so that, when it is taken out, it is exactly similar to the punch that formed it [ i.e. that stamped the matrix]. It also carries as a hollow the impression of the half-cylinder a b attached to one of the long pieces as we described previously. The resulting hollow is called the nick  [67] and must always be placed on the side that corresponds to the top of the letter  [68]; it allows the printers to detect whether the letter is the right way up or if it is upside down. See the article Printing. The two operations of taking up the metal from the ladle  [69] and pouring it into the mould are shown in figs. 5 and 6 of the image.</p>
	<p> There is another important action; at the instant that the metal is poured into the mould the latter must be jerked upwards so that the metal which is flowing downwards strikes the surface of the matrix more forcefully and takes up its stamp.</p>
	<p> When the workman has poured his metal he returns his casting ladle to the furnace and prepares to open the mould; to do this he first pushes aside the arc or archet from the recess of the matrix and puts it into a nick in the wood under the heurtoir. He opens the mould by separating its halves and, if the letter is stuck to one half [of the mould] he detaches it with the hook that is fixed to other half; this is called decrocher . This is what is being done in fig. 8 of the image [there is no figure 8!]. After this, the mould is closed again, the arc put back under the matrix, metal poured in and the whole operation repeated as many as three or four thousand times per day.</p>
	<p> It must not be thought that the letter coming out of the mould is finished, as least in respect of its body. The letter face is finished - be it elegant or ugly accordingly as the punch that stamped the matrix was well or poorly cut.</p>
	<p> Whatever the letter on the face, the counterpunches, punches, matrices etc. and the casting are the same; all the operations are identical for Arabic, Greek, French, Hebrew etc.</p>
	<p> As it comes out of the mould the letter carries a pyramidal excrescence attached by its top to the foot of the [shank of] the letter. The piece, called the jet is formed by the excess metal necessary for the casting of type, that was poured into the mould. It is easily separated from the body of the piece of type because of the narrow neck produced by the inclined planes of the components of the mould called the jets , as was explained above and is shown in fig. 16 of Plate II.  [70] Also the brittleness of the typemetal produced by the addition of antimony, almost like tempered steel, makes the separation easier; the piece of jet broken off is called the rompure .</p>
	<p> After all the letters are broken-off, that is the jet has been separated from all of them - the jets are returned to the molten typemetal - the letters are rubbed on a piece of millstone as seen in fig. 2 of Plate I [71]; the stone is known as the rubbing stone . This stone is between fifteen and twenty-five inches in diameter; it is the same kind of stone as Cutlers use for sharpening. To prepare the stone for use by the type founder, one takes two of them placed one on the other with river sand between them, and grinds them circularly, replacing the sand from time to time, until all the little lumps are ground away and the surfaces are flat and uniform. The sand grinds the millstones and does not polish them; little granules remain that remove the excrescences that the casting leaves on the type.</p>
	<p> Not all letters can be rubbed down; there are some - more frequently in italic than in roman faces – in which part of the character protrudes beyond the side of the body. If these were ground it is obvious that the stone would carry of this piece and deform the letter. So one begins by scraping gently and taking a small amount of metal off with a penknife, so that it [the piece of type] can fit properly into the space next to the neighbouring letter. This operation to remove the excess metal with the penknife is called cerner  [72].</p>
	<p> After the letter is kerned it is scraped and all the excess metal is removed with the penknife from the face right down to the foot. These two operations replace rubbing; kerned and scraped pieces of type meet and fit together just as well as those that have been rubbed. The two faces of the type that are rubbed on the stone are those that were against the blancs of the mould when the metal was poured; these surfaces [of the type] are rubbed to remove the swarf or granulation produced either by the surface of the blanc of one side or the long piece of the other side [of the mould].</p>
	<p> Once the pieces of type have been rubbed or kerned and scraped, they are arranged in a [compositor’s] stick – the stick seen in fig.5 Plate III of Typefounding [no such figure!! But see Planche IV fig 2] is a wooden rule with an upstand on which the type is put with the letter at the top and all the nicks turned to the same side in such a way that one has all the letters a arranged thus: a, a, a, a, a, a, etc. and not thus: ava , vav , and so for the other letters; this is made easy by observing the nicks  [73]. The pieces of type so arranged in the stick are moved to the iron rule of the justifier A B fig. 3 of the same Plate [no figure 3 see figs 1 & 2] they are placed with the foot uppermost and the letter against the horizontal face of the justifier, which is just, as can be seen, a composing stick made of metal. To this rule another, C D is, applied which has a shoulder at C similar to that at B on the first piece [fig. 3]; this rule also has at C and D little projections that enter the mortises a and b of figure 3 in such a way that when the two rules figs. 3 and 4 are applied one to the other, they enclose the whole row of type placed on the first rule; thus only the feet of the letters project about one line above the iron rules of the justifier.</p>
	<p> The justifier loaded thus with a row of type is placed between the two jaws A B, C D of the cutter shown in fig. 1 Plate IIII [fig 1 no 2?]. The cutter is a kind of heavy solid table to which are fixed the jaw A B which is a plank a good inch thick, and the iron bar F E which has a hook E at one end and a hook F at the other. The hook F is threaded and receives a screw by which the second rule of the justifier, described above, can be moved forward.</p>
	<p> The two rules of the justifier are held together by the other jaw C D shown as the lower part in fig. 2. A B, C D are two stout iron bars whose hooks, A, C, are attached to the table of the cutter; B D is another iron bar carrying a nut which receives the screw F E that is turned like a vice by a handle F G . The whole assembly is fixed to the table of the cutter in such a way that only the jaw C D pushed or pulled by the screw E F fig. 2 is able to move.</p>
	<p> It follows from this description that, if the screw E F of fig. 2 is turned, the jaw A B moves towards the fixed jaw C D, fig. 1 and that thus the two rules of the justifier are forced against the row of type that it contains. However, to force the pieces of type together in the row, the screw F f must be turned. This screw pushes the second rule of the justifier along the [side of] the row of type until its shoulder C fig. 4 meets the end of the row and pushes them together and towards the shoulder B of the first rule fig. 3 [fig. 2] until they are all pushed against each other. When this has happened, it is clear that the type forms a kind of solid bar contained between the shoulders of the two parts of the justifier, while the whole length of the sides of the row is compressed between the two jaws.</p>
	<p> However, before tightening the screws to compress the type in this way, a strip of hard wood is pushed against the projecting feet of the type to force the letter-faces against the horizontal plank of the justifier.</p>
	<p> When all is arranged, the type is cut with the plane as we shall now explain.</p>
	<p> The tool shown in fig. 6 of Plate III of typefounding [in fact, ie Suite de la Pl III  [74]] is called the plane . It consists of an iron chassis fig. 10 . Under the part N O of this box are screwed two guides Ce, Df [fig. 2 e Suite de la Pl III , top]. This assembly is surmounted by a piece of wood P Q seen in fig. 8 which serves as the handle of the plane. It is attached to the part N O, fig. 10 as can be seen in fig. 6. The iron A B of the plane is placed on the inclined face of the chassis held by the two tapped screws G H in the transverse iron, which are themselves fixed to the chassis as shown in R. All these parts assembled form the plane of fig. 6. The screws are tightened with the screwdriver of fig. 16 of the same Plate.</p>
	<p> When type is to be cut, the plane is placed on the justifier so that the projecting parts of the type are between the guides of the plane. The iron is raised or lowered - its cutting edge is slightly rounded – so that it shaves off as much material as one wishes to remove.</p>
	<p> There are directives about the height of letters; it is ordained that the height  [75] of the piece of type from the face to the bottom of the foot shall be ten and a half royal lines. This height is not the same everywhere; in Holland it is almost one line more than in Paris, while in Flanders, and even Lyon, it is more than ten lines. When printers, without regard to the regulations, want type more or less than ten and a half lines high the founder has little pieces to add to the letter mould between the jet and the long pieces [to adjust the height].</p>
	<p> The pieces are called hausses  [76]; according to the thickness of these the same mould can cast type with greater or lesser height to paper as this dimension is called.</p>
	<p> Because the plane iron is convex, the cut pieces of type will all have a little hollow [in the foot] so that, when they are standing on their foot they will bear only on two lines, so to say, instead of on the whole surface [of the foot]. The hollow in the foot of the type is intended so that the pieces of type will be easier to fit on the stone of the press because their bearing surface is small and less subject to disturbances by irregularities [in the surface of the stone].</p>
	<p> But this is not the only surplus material to be planed off; some must be cut from the height of the face as is shown in fig. 14 . This cut is applied to both sides of characters that have neither ascender nor descender but only to the side opposite to the ascender or descender if there is one. Fig. 14 shows that the letter B projects more than the letter A even though they were cast in the same mould.</p>
	<p> The device shown in fig. 14 holding the letters A and B mentioned above is called the justification ; it is used to ascertain, by means of the little rule seen in fig. 13 called a jetton , if the outlines of the letters are correctly aligned. To do this, once the letters m m, that we have said are the first to be cast, have been justified, one places an a , for example, between the two m s thus: mam , and tests whether the edge of the jetton rests equally on all three characters.</p>
	<p> The piece of glass, fig. 12 and its jetton fig. 11  [77] are used to test the thicknesses in the same way and both devices serve in the same way, to test using the jetton, whether the outlines of the characters lie in the same straight line, as we have just explained.</p>
	<p> By a fount  [78] of characters is understood, in Printing, a complete set of all capitals, lower case letters, accents, punctuation marks, numbers etc. needed to print a work, all cast on the same body .</p>
	<p> The body is of a fixed and determined thickness  [79] for each individual face it is this thickness that determines the spacing between the lines of a book and that gives its name to the face and not the form of the letter on the type. However, to explain further, one speaks of casting a Cicero on a St Augustin body as is done as a means of increasing the white space between lines of type.  [80]</p>
	<p> To form a clear understanding of the meaning of what are called in Typefounding and Printing the body, face-design and white space  [81] consider any line [of letterpress print] and imagine it divided into seven equal parts by [horizontal] parallel lines then imagine printed between these parallel lines one of the letters that printers call short  [82] such as a, c, m etc . to distinguish them from those with ‘tails’ such as p, q, d which they call long . Imagine that the [short] letter is traced between the parallels in such a way that its base rests on the third parallel counting from the bottom and that its top reaches the third parallel down from the top  [83] or, to put it another way, that it occupies the space of the three middle bands into which the parallel lines divide the line. Clearly, there remain two unoccupied bands above the three occupied by the short letters, and two below them. This understood, it is not difficult to understand the distinctions between face-design , body and white space . The body corresponds to the whole [height of the] line, the face-design fills the three bands in the centre and is the same height as the letter, and by the white space one understands the two empty bands above and below the face-design .</p>
	<p> Example.: The line A B represents the body-height; C D is the white-space above [the line]; E F is the white space below. </p>
	<p> Example.</p>
	<p> The line A B represents the body-height; C D is the white-space above [the line]; E F is the white space below.</p>
	<p> On the printed page, C D represents half the white space between a line and that above and E F half the white space between the same line and the one below.</p>
	<p> Some letters fill the whole height of the body, for example, j complete with its dot, as the example shows, capital Q in roman faces and </p>
	<p>  [84] and f in italic as well as the signs (, § , [ , etc.</p>
	<p> For the long letters such as d and q two parts must be distinguished, the body and the tail; the body fills the three middle bands in the same way as the short letters, and the tail occupies the two white bands either above [an ascender] or below [a descender] according to whether the tail points up or down. See , in the example, the d and the q . If there happens to be a q in one line and a d exactly underneath in the line below, there is no space at all between the tails; the ends [of the descender of the q and the ascender of the d ] touch. Thus is the relative height  [85] of the letter body and that of the face determined. Thus, is it necessary that Typefounding and Printing be subject to regulations? If not, [how] should the size of the letters or characters be determined relative to their height: no one has yet tried to regulate this.</p>
	<p> We invited M. Fournier to whom we owe the table of the relative sizes of type bodies to provide us with a table of the relative proportions of the letter sizes for each body. The latter is as important to the art of engraving letters [punch-cutting] as the former is for the perfection and convenience of the art printing.</p>
	<p> To this end one might consult the rules that the great writing-masters have prescribed and those that the best punch-cutters have followed as a matter of taste.</p>
	<p> An observation that presents itself naturally and which it will not be inappropriate to include here is that there is a relationship between printing and the characteristics of a particular language. For example, German is quite extraordinarily verbose, [in printed German text] there is almost no white space between the lines and the letters are very compressed together on the line; by this means the Germans try to recover the space on the page that the prolixity of their speech demands.  [86]</p>
	<p> But the expressions face-design, white space, face cast on the body of a different face etc. need no longer cause confusion.</p>
	<p> The terms light body and heavy body were used at the time when it was unknown what proportion the face-design should bear to the body and what the relation should be between [type of] other bodies and face-designs. This state of ignorance persisted among us until the year 1742 when M. Fournier le jeune, punch-cutter and typefounder, published his table of the relations between the various bodies of printing type . We shall not delay in describing it. But, before we do so, let us observe that before the appearance of this table there was no reliable rule for making type, each printer ordered type according to that which he already had in his possession, or that he thought he would like to have. No one had any [fixed] idea of either body size or letter size; for example, a Cicero face had as many heights of body and different face-designs as there were printing houses; and one which was called light in one place might be heavy in another, a large-face in one place might be small-face in another.</p>
	<p> One spoke of a fount of Cicero , of Petit-Romain etc . each time type was cast on a body so named. Type faces are bigger or smaller according to the needs - or the means - of the printer who orders them by weight  [87] or by the sheet  [88]. When a printer orders type by the five hundred pounds he means that a set of properly assorted characters of all kinds should weigh five hundred pounds. When he orders ten sheets he means by this the amount needed to set up ten sheets, thus twenty formes, for printing without needing to distribute the type  [89]. The typefounder then does his calculations; he allows one hundred and twenty pounds weight for each sheet, including the quads and spaces, or sixty pounds per forme which corresponds to half a sheet. This does not mean that the type for a sheet always weighs a hundred and twenty pounds nor that for a forme sixty; that all depends on the size of the forme and there is always some type left over in the compositor’s cases.</p>
	<p> Although all formes do not contain the same number of letters, nor the same varieties of letter, it should be remembered that, since a language has some sounds that occur more frequently than others, and thus some symbols that must recur more frequently than others in their use in printing, a fount does not contain the same number of letters a as it does b or c and so on. The determination of the proportions that there should be of the various characters making up a fount is called the police  [90]. Clearly the police may vary from one language to another but it is the same for all the varieties of face or size of type for a given language. To give an idea of the police in our French suppose that a fount of one hundred thousand characters [pieces of type] is required. To make up this number of a hundred thousand the following numbers of each character are required. This information has solved a problem for the Typefounders for which it would have been difficult to propose an exact solution in the past. I hope that the Philosophers and Grammarians will look with approval at the following table and ask for similar ones for Latin, Greek, English, Italian and most of the known languages. To find such tables they only need to address themselves to the Typefounders of the countries in which the languages are in use.</p>
	<p> Police for one hundred thousand letters intended for ordinary printing in French .</p>
	<p> The reader will notice that the table contains only grammatical symbols and that we are concerned here only with these. Consequently, this police is not intended for a book on algebra or arithmetic or chemistry but only for works of literature, poetry and so on.</p>
	<p> While it is clear that one police does not apply to different languages, it is equally evident that it does apply to all type faces [in printing a given language] whatever their body [size].</p>
	<p> There exist in Printing, or, rather, in Typefounding twenty different bodies.</p>
	<p> Each of these has its own unique name applied to faces cast on that body. The smallest is called Parisienne and in passing from Parisienne to the largest faces one has:</p>
	<p> Nompareille, Mignone, Petit-Texte, Gaillard, Petit-Romain, Philosophie, Cicéro, Saint-Augustin, Gros-Texte, Gros-Romain, Petit-Parangon, Gros-Parangon, Palestine, Petit-Canon, Trismégiste, Gros-Canon, Double-Canon, Triple-Canon, Grosse-Nompareille.</p>
	<p> See the articles on these faces under their proper names and, below, samples of these faces in the Plates at the end of this article. These plates are composed from the faces of M. Fournier le jeune from whom we have also taken all the material in the article and in the others on Typefounding. We may say with assurance that our Work [the Encyclopédie] would have left nothing to be desired about the Arts if we had always found persons as devoted to the progress of their art, as learned and as open as M. Fournier le jeune. One observation that we have had occasion to make a hundred times is that, of the artisans of a particular craft, it is the ignorant, and of all the different crafts, it is those which are the least developed and the poorest, that have shown themselves the most obscure; that stands to reason.</p>
	<p> These bodies [type sizes] follow each other in regular progression; the base-size, its double, triple quadruple and so on, and the others, made up of two or more in combination, always make up the [size of the] large body that is at the head of the combination; this regular relationship is essential to printing.</p>
	<p> However, to bring into existence this regularity to which we have just referred, and that will be well demonstrated in the table of size-relations below, M. Fournier was obliged to create a special body [size] called Gros-Texte equivalent to twice the body of Petit-Texte and to revive [the use of] two others that were unknown - or hardly known – Palestine and Trismégiste . The first is equivalent to twice the body size of Cicéro , the most commonly used type in printing; and the second is twice Gros-Romain.</p>
	<p> Without these three body sizes the series would not be continuous. In the following table the first column contains the name of the body and in the middle column the bodies which are its equivalents.</p>
	<p> The sign || in the text of the middle column indicates that the number of pieces of type that make up the size of the face named in the margin is about to change and that a different body size [type name] is about to follow; the number required to make up the size of [one piece of] the face named in the left column is given.</p>
	<p> But it was not enough to decide on the fixed number of twenty for the body sizes and to establish the size-relationships that must be maintained between the members of this twenty. It was also necessary to fix the absolute size of one of the bodies, no matter which. To do this, M. Fournier le jeune created a scale in consultation with the most experienced Typefounders.</p>
	<p> This scale is made up of two parts called inches ; these ‘inches’ however, are not the same length as those of the Royal Foot  [91]. We shall explain later the relation between the inch of the scale and the standard inch [one twelfth of the Pié de Roi]. He [Fournier] divides his inch into three lines and his line into three points  [92]. This scale is shown at the top of the table that follows  [93].</p>
	<p> This table has four columns:</p>
	<p> The first gives the order [serial number] of the types.</p>
	<p> In the second column are the names of the type and its equivalent size in terms of other types.</p>
	<p> In the third and fourth [columns] are the sizes  [94] in divisions of the scale.</p>
	<p> M. Fournier has thus set up quite a simple system by building his table of the relation between type sizes. One printer orders  [95], for example, a Cicéro from the Typefounder and sends a sample in letters  [96] [of the body] on which he wants the Cicéro to be cast. A different printer also orders a Cicéro and, since the type that both want carries the same name one would suppose that the type itself would be the same. Not at all; the sample sent by one of the printers is either bigger or smaller than that sent by the other and the Founder finds that he needs to adjust all his moulds, or even to make new ones. This whole business can run to extremes in the same way as other fantasies. It seems that there was more agreement among writers than there was among printers on the subject of the size and width of characters. They began by agreeing on the dimensions of the point of the pen, then they fixed the number of pen-points  [97] for each sort of character.</p>
	<p> In constructing his table of size relationships it would seem that M. Fournier followed the spirit of the Royal edict of 28 February 1723 for the regulation of printing that seems to have supposed the existence of [such a] table. For example : when the edict ordains that Gros-Romain should be equivalent to [the sum of] a Petit-Romain and a Petit-Texte, what is this intended to mean? Which Petit-Romain and which Petit-Texte should one choose? They are of different sizes everywhere. In setting out this regulation one would imagine that either there was an established table of relative sizes or that one was to be set up. But when a fixed and determined size for type had been set one would not yet have reached the state of perfection that one might have sought, for, to have a convenient equivalent to Gros-Romain it was not at all a Petit-Romain and a Petit-Texte that were needed. According to M. Fournier the body sizes of type had to progress by doubling or halving, for reasons that we shall explain, from which it followed that Gros-Romain must be equal in size to two Gaillardes and not to the sum of a Petit-Romain and a Petit-Texte.</p>
	<p> By establishing the sizes of type bodies M. Fournier has enabled Printers to calculate exactly how many more or fewer pages one face would require compared to another. For example, he can work out how many lines for a duodecimo (12 mo) to be set in Petit-Romain instead of in Cicéro or St. Augustin and how many pages per sheet one would gain or lose and hence how many more or fewer sheets a volume would contain printed in such and such a face.</p>
	<p> The [relative] sizes being established and known makes the mechanics of printing more reliable and certain; the workman, aware of the space occupied by his type, is able to fill the empty spaces in his works exactly whether in the setting of ornaments or in carrying out any other difficult task that needs judgment. If he has, for example, a space of six lines of Nompareille to fill he knows at once that he can substitute for it four lines of quads of Gaillarde, or three of Cicéro or two of Gros Romain or a single line of Trismégiste. He has a choice and all these will fill and make his white space without care or difficulty.</p>
	<p> By this means confusion in Printing is avoided, especially with faces called ‘ two-line letters’  [98] these letters must be cast so that they have exactly twice the body size of those whose ‘two points’ they are; see Two-Line Letters  [99]. But the bodies, whether Petit-Texte, Petit-Romain, or Cicéro being indeterminate in size, larger in one print-shop and smaller in another, it follows that these ‘two-line letters’ having no fixed relationship to their large bodies, form a multiplicity of different thicknesses or bodies in Printing; in spite of this, however, they have no other name than ‘two-line letters’.</p>
	<p> To use with these two-line letters there must be quads and spaces made expressly and adjusted to be of the same body height. The table simplifies this; two-line letters of Petit-Texte are cast on the Gros-Texte body; those of Petit-Romain are cast on the Petit-Paragon body, those of Cicéro are cast on Palestine and so on. Thus it is no longer necessary to cast special quads and spaces for two-line letters since those already in existence for the face of twice the body size can be relied upon to fit  [100].</p>
	<p> We observed at the beginning of this article that Typefounding has owed much for its progress since its birth until our own times to Simon de Colines, Claude Garamond, Robert Grandjean, Guillaume le Bé, and Jacques de Sanlecque, in the 15 th , 16 th and 17 th centuries, and in the 18 th century to MM Grandjean and Alexandre who devoted their efforts to the Imprimerie du Roi.</p>
	<p> But justice requires that we do not pass over in silence the contributions of M. Fournier le jeune to the Art since the times of these gifted men. He began by making the important table of the size relations [of various types] that we have discussed above. Then, in search of further useful innovation, he realised that printing lacked large capitals for posters, notices and titles. Those used before his work were too small and of outdated style; the wooden letters were frequently distorted and liable to breakage and rot etc. He cut letters of fifteen lines height thus much larger than the cast letters previously in use; then he continued the series from this size right down to the smallest.</p>
	<p> Then he doubled his efforts by making italic letters of the same size [range]; there were previously no letters of this kind available for printing. The largest [italic letters] were two-line Saint-Augustin or Gros-Romain – and these were skinny and ill-cut. It must not be denied that very well-designed letters of this kind were used in the Imprimerie Royale, but only up to a certain size; and for printers in other parts of the kingdom they might as well not have existed.</p>
	<p> The [existence of] these large capitals has almost extinguished the custom of printing notices and frontispieces in red and black. The words to be emphasised are brought out sufficiently by the use of combinations of lines of roman and italic whose design renders them sufficiently distinct. By this means double pulls in red and black  [101] are avoided and the elegance of title-pages is improved.</p>
	<p> Printing also hardly possessed the little cast ornaments called vignettes. Those that did exist were so old and outdated in style that they could hardly be used. M. Fournier, in imitation of masters Grandjean and Alexandre who had made very fine ones for the Imprimerie du Roi, has created more than one hundred and fifty varieties that he has cut in proportion to the type body size. For example, an ornament cut to be cast on a Cicéro body at half the body thickness only has to be turned over to serve for Nomparaille; another is square and equivalent to Cicéro in all dimensions; another of a Cicéro and a half corresponds to Gros Romain body, one of two Cicéros is for Palestine, and so on. Cast on a body of one size they are suitable for use with other body sizes according to how they are rotated; they present predetermined sizes whose space is exactly filled by [types of] other body sizes, larger or smaller.</p>
	<p> In this way, using combinations of the little objects, cast ornaments can be constructed larger or smaller according to need and wider or less wide according to the whim of the type compositor. See examples of these ornaments in the plates of faces at the end of this article.</p>
	<p> M. Fournier has made alterations to the cutting of punches for Plainsong music for which he has the gratitude of the printers of the various dioceses whom he has supplied. Sharp and flat signs etc. were cut and cast of various different sizes according to their shapes so that, to compose the music and align the lines, spaces of all sorts of sizes had to be cast – some of them extremely thin. These spaces carried four [parallel] lines; when assembled they produced the same number of breaks in the lines of the note because the alignment was never as good enough for [the defects in alignment] not to be visible; particularly when the type was somewhat worn these breaks became more apparent and could not but be disagreeable. In addition, the workman was always required to justify his line by packing it out as is done using spaces in a line of ordinary letters. To avoid these difficulties M. Fournier cut the punches for the notes, sharps, flats, guidons  [102] , rests etc . all of exactly the same size and the spaces with their four lines of the same thickness, or twice, three, four or five times as large; the thinnest [spaces] are half the thickness of the note. Thus, all the thicknesses being the same and known, when the printer has decided the length of the line, all the lines align automatically; all that need be done is to use the same number of notes or their equivalent in spaces, which is easily done. Once at the end of the line, a half-note is inserted, or its equivalent [space] or the equivalent of a note, or a space equivalent to several notes, according to the void to be filled and the line will be found to be justified. Errors in composition are not difficult to correct because one can always insert the exact equivalent of whatever has been removed. Since there is no need to justify using thin spaces, there are fewer breaks [in the stave] and the result is better.</p>
	<p> To bring all this about it is only necessary to make the lines attached to the note all the same length and to put the correct size of note, or other sign, on them as in the following example :</p>
	<p> M. Fournier removed from the notes used previously a useless duplication of eight kinds which were ugly as was apparent in the custom of putting the tails of the notes pointing downwards where they became mixed up with the notes below. To avoid this what had to be done? Simply to point the tails in the opposite direction as is done in [writing] Music. This expedient also has the advantage that one finds already in the set of notes the necessary material to do this without having to make it specially.</p>
	<p> For example :</p>
	<p> turn the notes upside down, and you will have,</p>
	<p> that is, the result desired, with less expense, without difficulty and with a better effect.</p>
	<p> See the example in the tables of characters that follow.</p>
	<p> Much use is now made in printing of rules, single, double or triple, which were not in use ten years ago, thanks to M. Fournier who invented a mould to cast them. They were previously made of copper or brass; they were expensive and never right. It would have taken too much time, and perhaps was not possible, to make flat strips of brass of the exact thickness of the several bodies of type [faces]. The only thing available was [to use] several strips of different thicknesses that were adjusted as best one could. M. Fournier’s mould remedies all this; it is a simple and convenient device fourteen or fifteen inches long by about an inch wide in which are cast strips of fourteen inches long and of the body size [height] of a given type face. The [one] mould serves for whatever height is desired; it only has to be adjusted - which can be done in a moment; the strips are put into the cutter, and with the plane used for letters, and some specially made tools, one cuts whatever pattern one wishes on one of the faces.</p>
	<p> This mould for rules was so well received that within two or three months of its use the other Typefounders rushed to imitate it: but their device was larger, more complicated and less convenient to use; master Fournier had not published his design and had reserved it for use [only] in his own Foundry. See the article Rules, for the explanation of the device and, in our Plates of Typefounding , an illustration of it and its details  [103].</p>
	<p> To add some variety to an impression and for use in some particular works, M. Fournier has just cut a new face in his series; it is in two parts and on two different bodies. The first, cast on the body of Grand Parangon is called bâtard coulee ; the other which has a larger letter-design is cast on Trismégiste and is called bâtard .</p>
	<p> These faces, which carry an alphabet of decorated and festooned letters to be used in place of small capitals, are made to work together and form a set called caractere de finance because they imitate writing. See the sample in the plates that follow.</p>
	<p> The most useful of M. Fournier’s contributions to printing, and which does him the most credit, after his table of corresponding sizes, is his modification of italic faces to which he has given a more firm shape in which he has made the open and the black areas more distinct and more similar to handwriting.</p>
	<p> At the beginning of this century, masters Grandjean and Alexandre made some changes in the italics that they cut for the Imprimerie du roi; their example encouraged M. Fournier. To help the reader to appreciate his work here are some lines of italics as he found them, and those with which he replaced them.</p>
	<p> Former Gros Romain Italic:</p>
	<p> New Gros Romain Italic:</p>
	<p> To measure the required proportions of the characters and to confirm their size one must carefully measure, on the text, a length of forty lignes according to M. Fournier’s scale : that is to say thirty-seven lignes in ordinary measure  [105] [and count the number of characters this length contains]. This number of lines should contain : 48 Parisiennes, or 40 Nomparailles, or 36 Mignones and 1 Gros Texte, or 30 Petits Textes, or 26 Gaillardes and 1 Nomparaille, or 24 Petits Romains, or 21 Philosophies and 1 Gaillarde, or 20 Cicéros, or 16 Saint-Augustins and 1 Gros Texte, or 15 Gros Textes, or 13 Gros-Romains and 1 Nomparaille, or 12 Petits-Parangons, or 10 Gros-parangons and 1 Petit-Parangon, or 10 Palestines, or 8 Petits-Canons and 1 Gros-Texte, or 6 Trismégistes and 1 Palestine, or 5 Gros-Canons and 1 Petit-Parangon, or 4 Double-Canons and 1 Gros-Texte, or 3 Triple-Canons and 1 Palestine, or 2 Grosses-Nomparailles and 2 Palestines.</p>
	<p> Should one find some large or small faces that are not mentioned in the table of sizes or the preceding list, this is because these large faces are not [now] cast and the small faces such as perle and sédanoise etc. do not have the correct proportions [to fit the scheme], even though the are [still] cast. In any case it is to be hoped that they would be adjusted to the proportions given in the table which would improve the quality of printing and make its practice easier.</p>
	<p> It remains only to say a word about the regulations to which Typefounders are subject.</p>
	<p> Before they start exercising their craft, Founders are required to present themselves to the syndics and adjoints d’Imprimerie and to be registered in the community register as Fondeurs de caracteres ; this registration is required to be carried out without any charge.</p>
	<p> Nevertheless, they are forbidden to work as Boooksellers [publishers] or Printers.</p>
	<p> They must reside and work in the University district.</p>
	<p> We have seen previously the details of the edict about the regulation of the proportions of type faces. The Founders are required to cast their faces of good and friable metal (see above for details of the type metal): to give priority to work for Parisian printers over those in the provinces: not to export any face without first reporting to the office of the Community its details, weight and quantity: to cast foreign faces to the dimensions of the Parisian faces: not to deliver type to anyone except printers.</p>
	<p> These, then, are the principal regulations from which one can see how imperfect they are and how doubtful it is that there has been any real advantage in the separation of the professions of Engraver [punchcutter], Typefounder and Printer.</p>
	<p> I have spared no effort to explain clearly everything about the first two which are essential preliminaries to the third. I hope that men of letters, who, through their [written] works have some claim to immortality, do not accuse me of being too prolix; as to the opinion of others, I care little. I would have written at much greater length had I not taken it upon myself to pass lightly over the less important procedures. On the other hand, I have attempted to describe the others in a way that respects the craft, and would help to preserve it were it ever in danger of being lost. For the next stages see the article on Printing. Do we owe less to Typefounding through which works of great genius are multiplied and preserved than we do to casting in bronze that celebrates heroes and their deeds? Se e Casting in bronze in the article Bronze.</p>
	<p> There follow examples of all the Type Faces in use: they come from the print house of M. le Breton , our printer, and the type Foundry of master Fournier, except only for Perle and Sédanoise , which are found only in the Imprimerie Royale, and which M. Anisson, director of that printing house, was anxious to include.</p>

It can be divided into Empirical Psychology(or Experimental) and Theoretical Psychology. The former draws on experience to develop its principles, by which it explains what takes place in the soul, while Theoretical Psychology, using these principles of experience to define the soul, infers then from this definition the diverse faculties and operations that befit the soul. This double method, a posteriori and a priori combined, produces the most exact proof that anyone can claim. Psychologycontributes principles to various other parts of Philosophy: to natural law, to Natural Theology, to Practical Philosophy and to Logic.

	eArt: `<p> Reason, one can form various notions of the word reason .</p>
	<p> 1. One can mean simply and in the broadest sense that natural faculty with which God endowed men to know truth, whatever light it follows, and to whatever class of subjects it applies.</p>
	<p> 2. One can mean by reason this same faculty considered, not absolutely, but only inasmuch as it functions in accordance with certain notions, which we bring with us at birth, and that are common to all men of the world. Others do not admit of these notions and understand by natural light the evidence of objects that strike the mind, and that demand its consent.</p>
	<p> 3. By reason one sometimes means that very natural light by which the faculty that we refer to by this name is guided. It is in this way that one ordinarily understands the term when one is speaking of a proof, or of an objection taken from reason, and which one wants to distinguish in this way from proofs and objections grounded in divine or human authority. To the contrary, when one says that that reason is mistaken, or that it is subject to error, that it is blind, or that it is depraved, one means the faculty that we call reason ; because it is clear that such statements fit very well the faculty, and not at all the natural light.</p>
	<p> 4. By reason one can also mean the sequence of truths that the human mind can attain naturally, without being aided by the light of faith. The truths of reason are of two types: some are what one calls eternal truths, which are absolutely necessary, to the point that the opposite would imply contradiction. Such are truths of which the necessity is logical, metaphysical, or geometric. One could not overturn these truths without being led to absurdities. There are others that could be called positive truths, because they are the laws that it pleased God to give to nature, or because they depend on nature. We learn them either by experience, that is to say, a posteriori, or by reason, and a priori, that is to say by considerations of convenience that caused them to be preferred. This convenience also has its rules and its reasons, but it is the free choice of God, and not a geometric necessity, that the convenient be preferred. Thus one can say that physical necessity is founded on moral necessity, that is to say on the choice of the wise and worthy person, worthy of his wisdom, and that one as well as the other must be distinguished from geometric necessity. This physical necessity is what makes the natural order, and consists of the rules of movement and of a few other general laws that God established in creating this universe. The laws of nature are always subject to the disposal of the legislator, who can, if he so chooses, stop and suspend them, whereas eternal truths, such as those of Geometry, are not subject to any arbitrary law. Now it is those last truths that faith would never oppose. The truth can never be attacked by an invincible objection, because if this argument is grounded on principles or incontestable facts, and established by a sequence of eternal truths, the conclusion is certain and incontrovertible, and anything which is opposed to it must necessarily be false, or otherwise two conflicting propositions could be true at the same time. If the objection is not demonstrative, it is no more than a plausible argument, which does not have force against faith, since it must be agreed that the mysteries of religion are contrary to appearances. See the article Mysteries, in which it is proved against Bayle that faith is in agreement with reason, meaning that series of eternal truths that are absolutely necessary. It is now necessary to establish the precise boundaries that lie between faith and reason .</p>
	<p> 1. No proposition can be accepted as divine revelation if it contradicts what is known to us, either by immediate intuition, as in the case of self-evident propositions, or by obvious deductions of reason, as in demonstrations. It would be ridiculous to give preference to such revelations, because the evidence that causes us to adopt them cannot surpass the certainty of our intuitive or demonstrative knowledge, even if it may sometimes equal it; such a preference would mean reversing the principles and foundations of all knowledge and assent. There would no longer be any clear marks of truth and falsity, no measure of the credible and the incredible if doubtful propositions took precedence over self-evident propositions. It is therefore useless to press as articles of faith propositions contrary to the clear perception that we have of the rectitude of our ideas. Consequently, reason is the true competent judge in every thing of which we have a clear and distinct idea. Though revelation, in agreeing with reason, can confirm these judgments, it cannot nullify its decrees in such cases. Wherever we have a clear and evident judgment of reason, we cannot be forced to renounce it to embrace the contrary opinion under the pretext that it is a matter of faith. The reason for this is that we are men before we are Christians.</p>
	<p> 2. God, in granting us the light of reason, did not forsake the liberty to give us, as he saw fit, the assistance of revelation in matters where our natural faculties cannot reach. In cases where it pleases God to supply us with this extraordinary assistance, revelation must overcome all resistance of our reason ; this resistance being founded on nothing more than probable conjectures. As the mind is uncertain of the truth of what is not self-evident to it, and in such cases is carried along by probability, it is forced to give its assent to an account that it knows to come from he who can neither deceive nor be deceived. When the principles of reason do not make us see plainly that a proposition is true or false, manifest revelation can resolve the mind, standing as another principle of truth. In this case a proposition supported by revelation becomes a matter of faith, and is above reason . Reason not being able to rise above probability, faith guides the mind where reason falls short.</p>
	<p> This far extends the influence of faith, without doing violence to reason, which is neither harmed nor harried, but aided and perfected by new lights emanating from the eternal source of all knowledge. Everything that is based on the jurisdiction of revelation must prevail upon our opinions, on our prejudices and on our interests, and has the right to demand of the mind its perfect assent. But such submission of our reason to faith may not reverse the limits of human knowledge, and does not shake the foundations of reason . Instead it leaves us the liberty to employ our faculties for the purposes for which they were given.</p>
	<p> If one does not take care to distinguish between the different domains of faith and reason by establishing these boundaries, reason will have no jurisdiction over religion, and one will have no right to scoff at the extravagant opinions and ceremonies that one observes in the majority of world religions. Who does not see that this opening would mean the way to the most incensed fanaticism, and the most foolish superstitions! With such a principle, there would be nothing so absurd that it could not be believed. It follows then that religion, which is the pride of humanity and the most excellent advantage of our nature over beasts, is often the thing in the world in which men appear the most unreasonable.</p>`,

	<p> Thus it is wrong that the same minister claims that the feeling of these idolators is much more equitable than that of the zealots who believe that only their own cult is agreeable to God, and one senses that by these zealots he wants to designate the Catholics.

Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life. Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life, the Universe and other things. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide.

While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally, many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.The study of religion encompasses a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies. Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology and history of the concept of religion</h4>
	<h3> Religion</h3>
	<p> Religion (from O.Fr. religion "religious community", from L. religionem (nom. religio) "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods", "obligation, the bond between man and the gods") is derived from the Latin religiō, the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to Cicero, connects lego "read", i.e. re (again) with lego in the sense of "choose", "go over again" or "consider carefully". Modern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell favor the derivation from ligare "bind, connect", probably from a prefixed re-ligare, i.e. re (again) + ligare or "to reconnect", which was made prominent by St. Augustine, following the interpretation of Lactantius. The medieval usage alternates with order in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders: "we hear of the 'religion' of the Golden Fleece, of a knight 'of the religion of Avys'".</p>
	<p> In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root religio was understood as an individual virtue of worship, never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge. The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and more prevalent colonization or globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages. It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other ancient sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written. For example, the Greek word threskeia, which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus and is found in texts like the New Testament, is sometimes translated as "religion" today, however, the term was understood as "worship" well into the medieval period. In the Quran, the Arabic word din is often translated as "religion" in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed din as "law". Even in the 1st century AD, Josephus had used the Greek term ioudaismos, which some translate as "Judaism" today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs. It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", and "Confucianism" first emerged. Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of "religion" since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this Western idea.</p>
	<p> According to the philologist Max Müller in the 19th century, the root of the English word "religion", the Latin religio, was originally used to mean only "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety" (which Cicero further derived to mean "diligence"). Max Müller characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called "law".</p>
	<p> Some languages have words that can be translated as "religion", but they may use them in a very different way, and some have no word for religion at all. For example, the Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as "religion", also means law. Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.</p>
	<p> There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in Hebrew, and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. One of its central concepts is "halakha", meaning the "walk" or "path" sometimes translated as "law", which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Faith</h3>
	<p> The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith or set of duties; however, in the words of Émile Durkheim, religion differs from private belief in that it is "something eminently social".</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Other terms</h3>
	<p> The use of other terms, such as obedience to God or Islam are likewise grounded in particular histories and vocabularies.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Definitions</h4>
	<p> There is no final definition of religion, even though many a scientist has and still tries to define religion. There are two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Religion as modern western construct</h3>
	<p> An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the "essence" of religion. They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the Peace of Westphalia). The MacMIllan Encyclopedia of Religions states:</p>
	<p> The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Classical definitions</h3>
	<p> Friedrich Schleiermacher in the late 18th century defined religion as das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl, commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".</p>
	<p> His contemporary Hegel disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."</p>
	<p> Edward Burnett Tylor defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings". He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.</p>
	<p> In his book The Varieties of Religious Experience, the psychologist William James defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine". By the term "divine" James meant "any object that is godlike, whether it be a concrete deity or not" to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.</p>
	<p> The sociologist Durkheim, in his seminal book The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things". By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits. On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred". Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.</p>
	<p> Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, Frederick Ferré who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively". Similarly, for the theologian Paul Tillich, faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned", which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."</p>
	<p> When religion is seen in terms of "sacred", "divine", intensive "valuing", or "ultimate concern", then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g. Richard Dawkins) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Modern definitions</h3>
	<p> The anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined religion as a</p>
	<p> […] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."</p>
	<p> Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that</p>
	<p> […] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it".</p>
	<p> The theologian Antoine Vergote took the term "supernatural" simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the "cultural reality" of religion, which he defined as</p>
	<p> […] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.</p>
	<p> Peter Mandaville and Paul James intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as</p>
	<p> […] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.</p>
	<p> According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:</p>
	<p> […] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Aspects</h4>
	<p> 	This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2015)</p>
	<p> A religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to an order of existence.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Practices</h3>
	<p> Main articles: Religious behaviour and Religious practice</p>
	<p> The practices of a religion may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of a deity, gods, or goddesses), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Worldview</h3>
	<p> Religions have sacred histories, narratives, and mythologies which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim to explain the meaning of life, the origin of life, or the Universe.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Religious beliefs</h3>
	<p> Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as actual or perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Mythology</h2>
	<p> The word myth has several meanings.</p>
	<p> 1. A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;</p>
	<p> 2. A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or</p>
	<p> 3. A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.</p>
	<p> Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are usually categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called "myths" in the anthropology of religion. The term "myth" can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. Joseph Campbell remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as other people's religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."</p>
	<p> In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true. Examples include the resurrection of their real-life founder Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the symbolism of the death of an old "life" and the start of a new "life" is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Social organisation</h3>
	<p> Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized clergy, and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Types and demographics</h4>
	<p> The list of still-active religious movements given here is an attempt to summarize the most important regional and philosophical influences on local communities, but it is by no means a complete description of every religious community, nor does it explain the most important elements of individual religiousness.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Types of religion</h3>
	<p> In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called "world religions." Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories:</p>
	<p> 1. world religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international faiths;</p>
	<p> 2. indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and</p>
	<p> 3. new religious movements, which refers to recently developed faiths.</p>
	<p> Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited. The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. "religions").</p>
	<p> Some scholars classify religions as either universal religions that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ethnic religions that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts. Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Demographics</h4>
	<p> The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of syncretism) and traditional folk religion.</p>
	<p> A global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious, 23% as not religious, 13% as "convinced atheists", and also a 9% decrease in identification as "religious" when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries. A follow up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as "convinced atheists". On average, women are "more religious" than men. Some people follow multiple religions or multiple religious principles at the same time, regardless of whether or not the religious principles they follow traditionally allow for syncretism.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Abrahamic</h4>
	<p> Abrahamic religions are monotheistic religions which believe they descend from Abraham.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Judaism</h2>
	<p> Judaism is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of ancient Israel and Judea. The Torah is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The Jewish people were scattered after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States. The largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Christianity</h2>
	<p> Jesus is the central figure of Christianity.</p>
	<p> Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth (1st century) as presented in the New Testament. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, and as Savior and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the Trinity, which teaches the unity of Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. Most Christians can describe their faith with the Nicene Creed. As the religion of Byzantine Empire in the first millennium and of Western Europe during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:</p>
	<p> • The Catholic Church, led by the Bishop of Rome and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a communion of 24 Churches sui iuris, including the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic churches, such as the Maronite Catholic Church.</p>
	<p> • Eastern Christianity, which include Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East.</p>
	<p> • Protestantism, separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation and is split into thousands of denominations. Major branches of Protestantism include Anglicanism, Baptists, Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Methodism, though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.</p>
	<p> There are also smaller groups, including:</p>
	<p> • Restorationism, the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the apostolic early church.</p>
	<p> • Latter Day Saint movement, founded by Joseph Smith in the late 1820s.</p>
	<p> • Jehovah's Witnesses, founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Islam</h2>
	<p> Muslims circumambulating the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam</p>
	<p> Islam is based on the Quran, one of the holy books considered by Muslims to be revealed by God, and on the teachings (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is the most widely practiced religion of Southeast Asia, North Africa, Western Asia, and Central Asia, while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Europe. There are also several Islamic republics, including Iran, Pakistan, Mauritania, and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p> • Sunni Islam is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the sunnah, whilst placing emphasis on the sahabah.</p>
	<p> • Shia Islam is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that Ali succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.</p>
	<p> • Ahmadiyya adherents believe that the awaited Imam Mahdi and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be Mirza Ghulam Ahmad by Ahmadis.</p>
	<p> • There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as Muwahhidism and Salafism.</p>
	<p> Other denominations of Islam include Nation of Islam, Ibadi, Sufism, Quranism, Mahdavia, and non-denominational Muslims. Wahhabism is the dominant Muslim schools of thought in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Other</h2>
	<p> The Bahá'í Faith is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder Bahá'u'lláh. One of its divisions is the Orthodox Bahá'í Faith.</p>
	<p> Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including Samaritanism (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the Rastafari movement (primarily in Jamaica), and Druze (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> East Asian religions</h3>
	<p> East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:</p>
	<p> • Taoism and Confucianism, as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.</p>
	<p> • Chinese folk religion: the indigenous religions of the Han Chinese, or, by metonymy, of all the populations of the Chinese cultural sphere. It includes the syncretism of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, Wuism, as well as many new religious movements such as Chen Tao, Falun Gong and Yiguandao.</p>
	<p> • Other folk and new religions of East Asia and Southeast Asia such as Korean shamanism, Chondogyo, and Jeung San Do in Korea; Shinto, Shugendo, Ryukyuan religion, and Japanese new religions in Japan; Satsana Phi in Laos; Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, and Vietnamese folk religion in Vietnam.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Indian religions</h2>
	<p> Indian religions are practiced or were founded in the Indian subcontinent. They are sometimes classified as the dharmic religions, as they all feature dharma, the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.</p>
	<p> • Hinduism is a synecdoche describing the similar philosophies of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and related groups practiced or founded in the Indian subcontinent. Concepts most of them share in common include karma, caste, reincarnation, mantras, yantras, and darśana. Hinduism is the most ancient of still-active religions, with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times. Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as Sanātana Dharma, which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.</p>
	<p> • Jainism, taught primarily by Parsva (9th century BCE) and Mahavira (6th century BCE), is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence for all forms of living beings in this world. Jains are found mostly in India.</p>
	<p> • Buddhism was founded by Siddhattha Gotama in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help sentient beings end their suffering (dukkha) by understanding the true nature of phenomena, thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth (saṃsāra), that is, achieving nirvana.</p>
	<p> • Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the Pali Canon.</p>
	<p> • Mahayana Buddhism (or the "Great Vehicle") under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent in China and are still relevant in Vietnam, Korea, Japan and to a lesser extent in Europe and the United States. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as Zen, Pure Land, and Soka Gakkai.</p>
	<p> • Vajrayana Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE. It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions and extends across all of Asia (cf. Mikkyō).</p>
	<p> • Two notable new Buddhist sects are Hòa Hảo and the Navayana (Dalit Buddhist movement), which were developed separately in the 20th century.</p>
	<p> Fresco of Guru Nanak at Goindwal Sahib Gurdwara</p>
	<p> • Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Sikh gurus in 15th century Punjab. It is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs. Sikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a Sant-Sipāhī—a saint-soldier, have control over one's internal vices and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the Guru Granth Sahib. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in Waheguru—represented by the phrase ik ōaṅkār, meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a praxis in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Local religions</h3>
	<h2> Indigenous and folk</h2>
	<p> Incense burner in China</p>
	<p> Indigenous religions or folk religions refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by shamanism, animism and ancestor worship, where traditional means "indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation…". These are religions that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe; they often have no formal creeds or sacred texts. Some faiths are syncretic, fusing diverse religious beliefs and practices.</p>
	<p> • Australian Aboriginal religions.</p>
	<p> • Folk religions of the Americas: Native American religions</p>
	<p> Folk religions are often omitted as a category in surveys even in countries where they are widely practiced, e.g. in China.</p>
	<br>
	<p> African traditional</p>
	<p> Further information: African diasporic religions</p>
	<p> African traditional religion encompasses the traditional religious beliefs of people in Africa. In north Africa, these religions have included traditional Berber religion, ancient Egyptian religion, and Waaq. West African religions include Akan religion, Dahomey (Fon) mythology, Efik mythology, Odinani of the Igbo people, Serer religion, and Yoruba religion, while Bushongo mythology, Mbuti (Pygmy) mythology, Lugbara mythology, Dinka religion, and Lotuko mythology come from central Africa. Southern African traditions include Akamba mythology, Masai mythology, Malagasy mythology, San religion, Lozi mythology, Tumbuka mythology, and Zulu mythology. Bantu mythology is found throughout central, southeast, and southern Africa.</p>
	<p> There are also notable African diasporic religions practiced in the Americas, such as Santeria, Candomble, Vodun, Lucumi, Umbanda, and Macumba.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Iranian</h2>
	<p> Iranian religions are ancient religions whose roots predate the Islamization of Greater Iran. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.</p>
	<p> Zoroastrianism is based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster in the 6th century BC. Zoroastrians worship the creator Ahura Mazda. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.</p>
	<p> Mandaeism is a monotheistic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the "Last Gnostics".</p>
	<p> Kurdish religions include the traditional beliefs of the Yazidi, Alevi, and Ahl-e Haqq. Sometimes these are labeled Yazdânism.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> New religious movements</h3>
	<p> • Shinshūkyō is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include Soka Gakkai, Tenrikyo, and Seicho-No-Ie among hundreds of smaller groups.</p>
	<p> • Cao Đài is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in Vietnam in 1926.</p>
	<p> • Raëlism is a new religious movement founded in 1974 teaching that humans were created by aliens. It is numerically the world's largest UFO religion.</p>
	<p> • Hindu reform movements, such as Ayyavazhi, Swaminarayan Faith and Ananda Marga, are examples of new religious movements within Indian religions.</p>
	<p> • Unitarian Universalism is a religion characterized by support for a "free and responsible search for truth and meaning", and has no accepted creed or theology.</p>
	<p> • Noahidism is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.</p>
	<p> • Scientology teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as auditing, in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience and understand painful or traumatic events and decisions in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.</p>
	<p> • Eckankar is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.</p>
	<p> • Wicca is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant Gerald Gardner, involving the worship of a God and Goddess.</p>
	<p> • Druidry is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.</p>
	<p> • There are various Neopagan movements that attempt to reconstruct or revive ancient pagan practices. These include Heathenry, Hellenism, and Kemeticism.</p>
	<p> • Satanism is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity (Theistic Satanism) or use "Satan" as a symbol of carnality and earthly values (LaVeyan Satanism).</p>
	<p> Sociological classifications of religious movements suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including "churches", "denominations", "sects", "cults", and "institutions".</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Interfaith cooperation</h3>
	<p> Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse, many religious practitioners have aimed to band together in interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and religious peacebuilding. The first major dialogue was the Parliament of the World's Religions at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, which affirmed "universal values" and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with Christian–Jewish reconciliation representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.</p>
	<p> Recent interfaith initiatives include "A Common Word", launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together, the "C1 World Dialogue", the "Common Ground" initiative between Islam and Buddhism, and a United Nations sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Academic study of religion</h4>
	<p> A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: theology, comparative religion, history of religion, evolutionary origin of religions, anthropology of religion, psychology of religion, including neurosciences of religion and evolutionary psychology of religion, sociology of religion, and Law and Religion.</p>
	<p> Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: animism and magic, by E.B. Tylor and J.G. Frazer; the psycho-analytic approach of Sigmund Freud; and further Emile Durkheim, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Mircea Eliade, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, and Clifford Geertz.</p>
	<p> Michael Stausberg gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including cognitive and biological approaches.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Comparative religion</h3>
	<p> Nicholas de Lange, Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at Cambridge University, says that</p>
	<p> The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern. The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Theories of religion</h3>
	<h2> Origins and development</h2>
	<p> The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.</p>
	<p> According to anthropologists John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."</p>
	<p> The development of religion has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their laws and cosmology to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as education, hospitals, the family, government, and political hierarchies.</p>
	<p> Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Cultural system</h2>
	<p> While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in religious studies courses, was proposed by Clifford Geertz, who simply called it a "cultural system". A critique of Geertz's model by Talal Asad categorized religion as "an anthropological category". Richard Niebuhr's (1894-1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Social constructionism</h2>
	<p> One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings. Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Law</h3>
	<p> The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980. Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, and discipline and love. Common topics of interest include marriage and the family and human rights. Outside of Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East and pagan Rome.</p>
	<p> Studies have focused on secularization. In particular the issue of wearing religious symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.</p>

	<h4> Related aspects</h4>
	<h3> Reason and science</h3>
	<p> Science acknowledges reason, empiricism, and evidence; and religions include revelation, faith and sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.</p>
	<p> The concepts of "science" and "religion" are a recent invention: "religion" emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation, "science" emerged in the 19th century out of natural philosophy in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ("natural science"), and the phrase "religion and science" emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts. It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", and "Confucianism" first emerged. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (scientia) and religion (religio) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.</p>
	<p> In general the scientific method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological questions about the universe that can be observed and measured. It develops theories of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as de facto verities in general parlance, such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution.</p>
	<p> Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.</p>
	<p> Regarding religion and science, Albert Einstein states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." </p>
	<br>
	<h3> Morality and religion</h3>
	<p> Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the Triple Jems of Jainism, Judaism's Halacha, Islam's Sharia, Catholicism's Canon Law, Buddhism's Eightfold Path, and Zoroastrianism's "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others. Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion although this is "an almost automatic assumption." According to The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics, religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."</p>
	<p> According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week have higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors. Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.</p>
	<p> A comprehensive study by Harvard University professor Robert Putnam found that religious people are more charitable than their irreligious counterparts. The study revealed that forty percent of worship service attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services. Moreover, religious individuals are more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%). Other research has shown similar correlations between religiosity and giving.</p>
	<p> Religious belief appears to be the strongest predictor of charitable giving. One study found that average charitable giving in 2000 by religious individuals ($2,210) was over three times that of secular individuals ($642). Giving to non-religious charities by religious individuals was $88 higher. Religious individuals are also more likely to volunteer time, donate blood, and give back money when accidentally given too much change. A 2007 study by the The Barna Group found that "active-faith" individuals (those who had attended a church service in the past week) reported that they had given on average $1,500 in 2006, while "no-faith" individuals reported that they had given on average $200. "Active-faith" adults claimed to give twice as much to non-church-related charities as "no-faith" individuals claimed to give. They were also more likely to report that they were registered to vote, that they volunteered, that they personally helped someone who was homeless, and to describe themselves as "active in the community."</p>
	<p> Some scientific studies show that the degree of religiosity is generally found to be associated with higher ethical attitudes — for example, surveys suggesting a positive connection between faith and altruism. Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by The Barna Group, those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: cohabitating with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an abortion, sexual relationships outside of marriage, gambling, looking at pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior, getting drunk, and "having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Politics</h3>
	<p> Religion has a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of sharia, the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as The Islamic Republic of Iran. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57 billion people who are Muslims. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the United States, 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely. Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress (Kyrsten Sinema, D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation. In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics although it used to be much more important. For instance, same-sex marriage and abortion were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually Catholic) doctrine. Several European leaders are atheists (e.g. France’s president Francois Hollande or Greece's prime minister Alexis Tsipras). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, India is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes. By contrast, countries such as China or Japan are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.</p>

	<h3> Economics</h3>
	<p> Further information: Religion and business and Wealth and religion</p>
	<p> One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations. In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves "religious", whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as "religious").</p>
	<p> Sociologist and political economist Max Weber has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their Protestant work ethic.</p>
	<p> According to a study from 2015, Christians hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by Muslims (5.8%), Hindus (3.3%) and Jewish (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification Irreligion or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Health</h3>
	<p> Mayo Clinic researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."</p>
	<p> The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is "largely beneficial", based on a review of related literature. According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." </p>
	<p> An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Superstition</h3>
	<p> Superstition has been described as "the incorrect establishment of cause and effect" or a false conception of causation. Religion is more complex and is mostly composed of social institutions and morality. But some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition. Some atheists, deists, and skeptics regard religious belief as superstition.</p>
	<p> Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (deisidaimonia), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods superstitio.</p>
	<p> Ancient greek historian Polybius described superstition in Ancient Rome as an instrumentum regni, an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the Empire.</p>
	<p> The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110). "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16-22" (para. #2111)</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Secularisation</h2>
	<p> Secularization is the transformation of a society from close identification with religious values and institutions toward nonreligious values and secular institutions. The term secularization is also used in the context of the lifting of the monastic restrictions from a member of the clergy.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Agnosticism and Atheism</h2>
	<p> The terms "atheist" (lack of belief in any gods) and "agnostic" (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of "religious". There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or nontheistic. The true opposite of "religious" is the word "irreligious". Irreligion describes an absence of any religion; antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Criticism of religious violence</h4>
	<h3> Violence</h3>
	<p> Critics like Hector Avalos Regina Schwartz, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.</p>
	<p> Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that " virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Animal sacrifice</h3>
	<p> Done by some (but not all) religions, animal sacrifice is the ritual killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a deity. It has been banned in India.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Senses. The senses are a faculty of the soul through which it perceives external objects. This occurs by means of some action or impression made on certain parts of the body, called the sense organs, which communicate this impression to the brain.</p>
	<p> Some people give a broader meaning to senses ; they define them as a faculty through which the soul receives ideas or images of objects, whether this occurs by means of an impression made by these objects externally or by some action on the soul itself.</p>
	<p> If one considers the senses from this point of view, two types have to be distinguished, external and internal senses ; this corresponds to the two different ways in which the images of objects we perceive are produced and communicated to the mind. These images can come directly from the outside, that is, by means of the five external senses —hearing, sight, taste, touch, and smell—or they can be internal, produced by the inner senses , like imagination, memory, attention, to which can be added hunger, thirst, pain, etc.</p>
	<p> The external senses are the means through which the soul can perceive or take cognizance of external objects. Such means can be considered from the point of view of the mind as well as from the point of view of the body. Mental capacities always remain the same. It is always the same faculty that makes it possible for us to see or to hear. The physical means are as varied as the objects we must perceive. This is why there are so many different organs of feeling. Each is constituted in such a way as to give the soul some representation and some information about the state of external objects, about their proximity, their fitness or unfitness, and other qualities. Moreover, the impressions vary according to the degree of distance, the proximity of danger, or the advantage to be derived. It is this which leads to the differing functions of the various organs, such as hearing, seeing, sniffing or smelling, tasting, touching.</p>
	<p> An excellent modern author gives a very ingenious explanation of the senses ; according to his principles, the senses should be defined as the capacity to perceive or to receive ideas. Sometimes, instead of capacity, he prefers to call it the predisposition of the mind to receive ideas; he calls sensations the ideas which are perceived in this way or which arrive in the mind.</p>
	<p> Thus, the external senses are the same thing as the capacity of receiving ideas under the stimulus of exterior objects. In such cases the soul is purely passive. It can neither prevent the perception nor the idea, nor vary the way in which it is received as long as the body remains capable of receiving impressions from external objects.</p>
	<p> Whenever two perceptions are completely different from each other, or when they merely fall under the general related category of sensation, then we give the name of different senses to the capacity of the soul to receive perceptions which are so different from each other. Thus, sight and hearing denote the distinction between the capacity to receive ideas of color and of sound, in spite of the fact that there can be great variation in colors or sounds. Nevertheless even among the most disparate colors there exist greater interrelations than there can exist between a color and a sound; and that is why colors are considered perceptions of the same sense; all senses seem to have their particular organ except for the sense of touch. This sense is distributed over the entire body.</p>
	<p> The internal senses are an energy or firmness of the mind. The mind depends upon ideas received through the perception of objects by the external senses . The internal senses are of two kinds, deriving either from pleasing and lovely forms of natural objects, or from beautiful actions.</p>
	<p> If we reflect about the nature of our external senses , it becomes clear that the perception of pleasure or pain does not depend upon our will. Objects do not please us because we so wish it. There exist objects which are necessarily agreeable to us and others which we dislike in spite of ourselves. The only way in which we can, by our own volition, receive pleasure or avert evil is by acquiring pleasurable objects or by protecting ourselves from evil. It is in our nature to respond with pleasure to the one and uneasily to the other. As a matter of fact, the pleasant or unpleasant sensation is immediate without our knowing what caused it, without our awareness of the circumstances out of which it arose, and without the perception of the usefulness or inconvenience that may result from the use of these objects. Even the most perfect acquaintance with such things would not alter the sensation of pleasure or pain. Yet one might derive a rational pleasure, quite different from the pleasure of emotion, or feel satisfaction at the thought of advantages that can be expected from the object; one can also experience a sense of aversion at the mere apprehension of evil.</p>
	<p> Almost all objects with which our soul concerns itself give rise to a feeling of well-being or anxiety; thus we may find ourselves pleasantly affected by a regular form, an architectural construction, a painting, a piece of music, and we have an inward feeling that this pleasure arises spontaneously from the contemplation of the idea that is then present in our mind together with all its contingent attributes. It is true that some of the ideas contain nothing of what we call sense perception. Even when sense perception is present our pleasure comes from some kind of uniformity, order, arrangement, or imitation and not from simple ideas of color or sound.</p>
	<p> This seems to indicate that when teaching, education, or some prejudice gives rise to desire or repugnance in relation to some object, this desire or aversion is based on our conception of perfection or imperfection. Thus, if someone who is deprived of the sense of sight is affected by the desire for beauty, this desire must come from a feeling of regularity of form, of gracefulness in the voice, of tenderness, of softness, or some other quality that can only be perceived by senses other than sight, and without any relation to color.</p>
	<p> Our philosophers only seem to take into account that pleasure of feeling which accompanies simple ideas of sensation. But there exist a great many agreeable feelings within those complex notions of objects which we call "beautiful" or "harmonious." It does not matter whether or not such notions of beauty and harmony are called "external sense perceptions" of sight and hearing. They should really be called an "internal sense" or an "internal feeling" if only to distinguish them from those other sensations of sight or hearing which can exist without any perception of beauty or harmony.</p>
	<p> At this point we are faced with the question whether our senses can be a touchstone of truth. This would depend on the way in which we look at the senses . When we want to present the most persuasive proof that something is true, we say that we have seen it with our own eyes; and if we really did see, one cannot fail but give credence to our assertion. In this case, the testimony of the senses is a first truth because it takes the place of the first principle without any need for looking further. Everyone agrees on that. On the other hand, it is also agreed that senses deceive, and experience shows that this cannot be doubted. Yet, if we are certain of the thing we have seen because we have seen it, how can the sense of sight deceive us, and if it can deceive us, how can we be sure of something simply because we saw it?</p>
	<p> The common answer to this difficulty is that our sight and our senses can deceive us when they are not being exercised appropriately: the organ should be properly formed and the object should be at the right distance. But this really says nothing. What is the use of establishing rules to justify the testimony of our senses , on the basis of conditions which we could not ourselves defend, even though we know the circumstances under which they occur. What infallible rule can there be to judge whether the organ of my sight, my hearing, my sense of smell is actually properly adjusted? Our organs can only provide complete certitude when they are perfectly formed; this they are only in the case of perfect temperaments; and since these are extremely rare, it follows that there exists scarcely an organ that is not defective somewhere.</p>
	<p> No matter how obvious this conclusion may seem, however, it does not destroy another truth, namely, that one is sure of what one sees. This contradiction shows that something has been left out, because a well-founded maxim cannot be in contradiction with another well-founded maxim. In order to develop this, let us examine in what way our senses are not a rule of truth, and how they are.</p>
	<p> 1. Our senses do not tell us what makes up that arrangement of bodies which is called "quality" and which creates certain impressions. Obviously I perceive that there is a certain arrangement in the body that makes me feel heat and weight; but what this arrangement is in itself ordinarily escapes my senses and often even my reason. I can perceive that with a certain arrangement and a certain movement in the smallest particles of this body, there exists a correlation between the body and the impression it makes upon me. Thus I conjecture that the sun's capacity to arouse in me a feeling of light consists in a certain movement or impulsion of little corpuscles through the pores of the air toward the retina of my eye; yet it is precisely this capacity that neither my eyes nor my reason can apprehend.</p>
	<p> 2. Our senses give no evidence at all of the infinite variety of combinations existing within the objects themselves which surpass the discernment of our sight, our hearing, our sense of smell. This can be clearly attested by the microscope; it has revealed to sight an infinite number of external combinations which indicate an equal variety in the internal parts. This complexity in turn produces a great variety of qualities. More perfect microscopes will reveal to us even further arrangements which at present we can neither perceive nor imagine.</p>
	<p> 3. The senses cannot teach us precisely what impressions other men receive through them. Such impressions depend upon the disposition of our organs which differ as widely as men's temperament or appearance; besides, the same external quality can produce different sensations in different men; we can see this every day. A certain liquid produces in me an unpleasant sensation and a pleasant one in someone else; therefore I cannot be sure that a certain body will produce upon someone else the exact same impression it made on me. Neither can I be certain that what I consider to be white does not appear as red to someone else.</p>
	<p> 4. Reason and experience teach us that bodies are in a continuous state of movement or change which is frequently quite imperceptible. We cannot know with any certainty whether a body has precisely the same quality from one day to the next, or the same capacity to produce an impression that it might have had previously. The body can alter and so can I. I may well be aware of a change in the impression produced, but the senses alone will not inform me whether this change is due to the object or to myself.</p>
	<p> 5. Our senses do not permit us to judge either the absolute size of bodies or their absolute movement. The reason for this is obvious. Since our eyes differ, we cannot all have the same idea of the size of a body. We have to suppose that our eyes are merely natural spectacles and that the fluid in them produces the same effect as lenses do in spectacles, so that, according to the distance of the eyes from each other, according to the shape of the lens of the eye and its distance from the retina, we see objects differently. All this makes it impossible to affirm that there can exist two men who see the same size or the same details in objects, since it is impossible to state that their eyes are absolutely identical. Another natural consequence is that we cannot estimate the true or absolute length of movement of a body, but merely the relationship that these movements have to each other. It is an established fact that we can estimate the extent of the movement of a body only by the length of the distance this body has traveled. Thus, since our eyes cannot show us the real length of the distance, it follows that they cannot show us the full extent of the movement.</p>
	<p> Let us now examine what can be taken for first truths in the testimony of our senses . The first truths we receive from our senses can be reduced to three main categories:</p>
	<p> Our senses always communicate very faithfully the impression they receive. These impressions almost always conform to truth in those matters which men need to know, unless there appears to be some reason for doubting them. (3) It is easy to judge when the testimony of the senses is doubtful on the following grounds:</p>
	<p> 1. The senses always communicate faithfully the impressions they receive. This is obvious because the senses are natural faculties dependent on the impressions they receive from objects. The relationships between the impression and what the senses communicate remain consistent. Someone on a fast moving ship will say that the shore moved in the opposite direction; it has to be this way, for the eye receives the same impression as it would if the shore line and the ship were actually moving in opposite directions; this is taught by observation in physics and by the rule of optics. From this point of view our senses never deceive us; it is our lack of caution which, in spite of their accurate report, causes us to deceive ourselves. Their accuracy does not consist in informing the soul of what exists but of what seems to be. It is up to the soul to discern the truth.</p>
	<p> 2. What appears to our senses is almost always consistent with truth, where the normal behavior and needs of life are concerned. Thus, for food, our senses make us sufficiently aware of the usual needs; in this way, the more something is to our advantage the greater ordinarily the number of sensations which permit us to recognize it; what we do not recognize with the help of the senses belongs not to our needs but to our curiosity.</p>
	<p> 3. The testimony of the senses is infallible unless it is contradicted either by our reason or by a previous testimony of the same senses , either by the present testimony of another of our own senses , or by the testimony of another man's senses .</p>
	<p> 1. When our reason, relying on other sources, makes us take a decision in evident opposition to what appears to the senses , their testimony on this point cannot be a touchstone of truth. Thus, though the sun seems to be two feet in size and the stars one inch in diameter, reason, informed by incontestable facts and by obvious knowledge, teaches us that these heavenly bodies are infinitely larger than they seem to us.</p>
	<p> 2. When what appears now to our senses is different from what appeared to them previously: in this case we realize either that the object is no longer within reach, or that some change has occurred in the object or in our organ. In such cases one should decide not to judge at all rather than to make a wrong judgment.</p>
	<p> Usage and experience help to distinguish the testimony of the senses . A child who perceives his image in water or in a mirror takes it for another child who is in the water or inside the mirror; but having experimented with putting his hand in the water or against the mirror, he will amend the sense of sight by means of the sense of touch and with time he will become convinced that there is no child where he thought he was seeing one. It can also happen that some Indian, coming from a country where water never freezes, will take a piece of ice for a stone; but after experience has shown that the piece of ice will turn to water, he amends the sense of touch by the sense of sight.</p>
	<p> 3. The third rule concerns the case when what appears to our senses is contrary to that which appears to the senses of other men, who are clearly constituted as we are. If my eyes show me something different from what appears to the eyes of all others, I have to believe that it is I who am in error rather than all the others; otherwise nature would be misleading a great number of men, which is not reasonable. See the Logic of Father Buffier, under the title of "First Truths."</p>
	<p> This same author also states that some philosophers have been concerned with showing that our eyes constantly mislead us because they cannot properly show true size; but I would like to ask these philosophers if our eyes were given to us to judge the absolute size of objects. Everybody knows that the real function of the eyes is to observe color. It is true that accidentally, due to the different angles according to which rays of light strike the retina, the mind responds by making judgments about the distance and the size of objects. But that judgment is no more special to the sense of sight than it is to the sense of hearing. The latter also attests, almost accidentally, to the size and distance of resonant bodies, which cause more or less strong undulatory movements that make more or less of an impression on the ear. Would one have a serious proof that the senses are in error because the ear does not permit us to make a correct judgment of the size and distance of objects? It does not seem so. In such cases, after all, the ear is not really carrying out its proper function as organ of hearing but contributes by accident, as it were, to the sense of touch, which is the sense that should judge the size and distance of objects.</p>
	<p> General usage will convince us of this. Size is measured in inches, feet, handbreadths, cubits, all of which are part of the human body. In spite of the fact that the organ of touch is scattered over the entire body, it is nevertheless most noticeably located in the hand. It is therefore the hand that should rightly measure size by relating its own dimensions to the size of the object to which it is applied. Unless the testimony of the eyes is verified by the hand, any testimony by the eyes concerning size must be suspect. This does not render the sense of sight in any way more misleading or less perfect. It is in its nature to discern color and only incidentally the distance and size of objects. What good would it do to bring up here the example of the fly whose tiny eyes see objects in a totally different dimension than the eyes of an elephant? What conclusion can we draw: if the fly and the elephant had any intelligence, they would not have a false idea of size; for since size is relative, each would judge the dimension of an object according to its own size, which it can comprehend; they could say to themselves: "This object is so many times greater or smaller than my body, or a particular part of my body"; and in this way, in spite of the difference of their eyes, their judgment of size would always be true.</p>
	<p> The same thing happens with men; no matter what impression the dimension of objects makes upon their eyes, all have an equally accurate idea of size because each measures it in relation to his proper size.</p>
	<p> We can say of our senses what we say of reason. When reason is thoughtfully directed, when it follows the natural insights God gave us, when it follows only the light of evidence and stops when ideas fail, then reason cannot mislead us. In the same way, the senses cannot mislead us when they act together, when they help each other and above all make use of experience. It is experience above all that cautions us against many of the errors that the senses by themselves could cause. Long usage alone teaches us to judge distances by sight and this, by examining, through touch, bodies we see, by observing bodies placed at different distances and in different ways, while being aware of the fact that the bodies themselves undergo no change.</p>
	<p> All men have acquired this skill in early childhood; they constantly have to pay attention to the distance of objects; thus, imperceptibly, they learn to judge distance and later they persuade themselves that this is a gift of nature while it is actually the effect of long practice. The way in which vision is developed proves that the faculty of judging those objects we see is a skill acquired with usage and experience. If any doubt remains on this score it will be rapidly dispelled by the example of a young man born blind, who at the age of fourteen or so saw light for the first time. Here is the story as it is related by M. de Voltaire. </p>
	<p> In 1729 Mr. Chiselden, a famous surgeon, who combined the skill of his hands with great wisdom, thinking that one could restore sight to a person born blind by couching what one calls cataracts, which he suspected were formed in the eyes at birth, offered to perform this operation. The blind man consented reluctantly. He could not imagine that the sense of sight would greatly increase his pleasures. Had it not been that he became eager to learn to read and write, he would not have wished to acquire sight. Whatever the case, the operation took place and was successful. The young man, aged fourteen or so, saw light for the first time. His experience confirmed the predictions of Locke and Barclay [ s. For a long time he could distinguish neither sizes nor situations nor even shapes. An object one inch in size put directly before his eyes and hiding a house seemed to him the same size as a house. Everything he saw at first seemed to him directly in contrast with his eyes, touching them as tactile objects touch the skin. He could not distinguish what he had known as being round with the help of his hands from what he knew to be angular; nor could he discern with his eyes whether what his hands had shown him to be below or above really was that way. He was so far removed from recognizing size that after having finally understood that his house was bigger than his room he could not comprehend how sight could give him this understanding. It was only after two months of experience that he was able to recognize that paintings could show solid bodies; and when, after feeling his way for a long time with a sense that was new to him, he realized that not only flat surfaces but three-dimensional bodies were represented on the canvas, he extended his hand and was astonished not to feel the object he was beginning to perceive. He asked which of the senses was misleading him: sight or touch.</p>
	<p> If we add analogy to the testimony of the senses , we shall find in that another proof of the truth of things. Analogy has as its basis the very simple principle that the universe is governed by general and constant laws. By virtue of this we admit the following rule: Similar effects have the same causes.</p>
	<p> The usefulness of analogy consists in the fact that it saves us thousands of useless discussions which we would have to repeat for each particular subject. It is sufficient for us to know that everything is ruled according to general laws in order to have a justification for believing that bodies which appear similar to us have the same properties, that the fruit from the same tree all has similar taste, etc. The certainty that accompanies analogy extends to the senses , which in their turn are the basis of all reasoning by analogy.</p>
	<p> Speaking of knowledge, we have said that without the help of the senses , man could acquire no knowledge of bodily objects; but at the same time we have noted that the senses alone were not sufficient, since there exists not a single man capable of examining by himself all those things necessary for living. This means that in an infinite number of cases men have to learn from each other and have to communicate their observations to each other; otherwise they could not benefit in any way from most of the things that God has granted them. This leads us to conclude that it is God's will that under certain circumstances the testimony of the senses be another sign of truth. But, if in certain cases the testimony is infallible, the senses must be equally so, since the testimony is based on the senses . Thus, if we prove that in certain cases the testimony of men is a reliable rule for truth, this proves the same thing for the senses on which this testimony is necessarily based.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> A sense is a physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception. The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience, cognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The nervous system has a specific sensory nervous system, and a sense organ, dedicated to each sense.</p>
	<p> Humans have a multitude of senses. Sight (vision), hearing (audition), taste (gustation), smell (olfaction), and touch (somatosensation) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood). However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders between responses to related stimuli lie.</p>
	<p> Other animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields, and detect water pressure and currents.</p>
	<p> Definition[edit]</p>
	<p> Detail of The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste, Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1618</p>
	<p> A broadly acceptable definition of a sense would be "A system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that responds to a specific physical phenomenon, and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted." There is no firm agreement as to the number of senses because of differing definitions of what constitutes a sense.</p>
	<p> The senses are frequently divided into exteroceptive and interoceptive:</p>
	<p> Exteroceptive senses are senses that perceive the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, as well as thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction).[1] Proprioceptive senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).</p>
	<p> Interoceptive senses are senses that perceive sensations in internal organs.</p>
	<p> Non-human animals may possess senses that are absent in humans, such as electroreception and detection of polarized light.</p>
	<p> In Buddhist philosophy, Ayatana or "sense-base" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.</p>
	<p> Traditional senses[edit]</p>
	<p> Sight[edit]</p>
	<p> In this painting by Pietro Paolini, each individual represents one of the five senses.[2]</p>
	<p> Sight or vision (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the capability of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible light on photoreceptors in the retina of each eye that generates electrical nerve impulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive to dim light. There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue[citation needed] that stereopsis, the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the visual cortex of the brain where patterns and objects in images are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.</p>
	<p> The inability to see is called blindness. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from stroke (infarcts in the brain). Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications.</p>
	<p> People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as blindsight. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the stimulus.</p>
	<p> On February 14, 2013 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.[3]</p>
	<p> Hearing[edit]</p>
	<p> Hearing or audition (adjectival form: auditory) is the sense of sound perception. Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the inner ear, which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000 hertz,[4] with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called deafness or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as vibrations conducted through the body by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.[5]</p>
	<p> Taste[edit]</p>
	<p> Taste or gustation (adjectival form: gustatory) is one of the traditional five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the "sense" of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five basic tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Other tastes such as calcium[6][7] and free fatty acids[8] may also be basic tastes but have yet to receive widespread acceptance. The inability to taste is called ageusia.</p>
	<p> Smell[edit]</p>
	<p> Smell or olfaction (adjectival form: olfactory) is the other "chemical" sense. Unlike taste, there are hundreds of olfactory receptors (388 according to one source[9]), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what we perceive as the molecule's smell. In the brain, olfaction is processed by the olfactory system. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called anosmia. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect pheromones.[10]</p>
	<p> Touch[edit]</p>
	<p> Touch or somatosensation (adjectival form: somatic), also called tactition (adjectival form: tactile) or mechanoreception, is a perception resulting from activation of neural receptors, generally in the skin including hair follicles, but also in the tongue, throat, and mucosa. A variety of pressure receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of itching caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord.[11] The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile anesthesia. Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.</p>
	<p> Non-traditional senses[edit]</p>
	<p> Balance and acceleration[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Vestibular system</p>
	<p> Balance, equilibrioception, or vestibular sense is the sense that allows an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found in both of the inner ears. In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of angular momentum acceleration and linear acceleration (which also senses gravity), but they are known together as equilibrioception.</p>
	<p> The vestibular nerve conducts information from sensory receptors in three ampulla that sense motion of fluid in three semicircular canals caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head. The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the utricle and the saccule, which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of otoliths (which are small crystals of calcium carbonate) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.</p>
	<p> Temperature[edit]</p>
	<p> Thermoception is the sense of heat and the absence of heat (cold) by the skin and internal skin passages, or, rather, the heat flux (the rate of heat flow) in these areas. There are specialized receptors for cold (declining temperature) and for heat (increasing temperature). The cold receptors play an important part in the animal's sense of smell, telling wind direction. The heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in pit vipers. The thermoceptors in the skin are quite different from the homeostatic thermoceptors in the brain (hypothalamus), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.</p>
	<p> Proprioception[edit]</p>
	<p> Proprioception, the kinesthetic sense, provides the parietal cortex of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.[12]</p>
	<p> Pain[edit]</p>
	<p> Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain.[13] The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.</p>
	<p> Other internal senses[edit]</p>
	<p> An internal sense also known as interoception[14] is "any sense that is normally stimulated from within the body".[15] These involve numerous sensory receptors in internal organs, such as stretch receptors that are neurologically linked to the brain. Interoception is thought to be atypical in clinical conditions such as alexithymia.[16] Some examples of specific receptors are:</p>
	<p> Hunger (motivational state) is a sensation that is governed by a set of brain structures (e.g., the hypothalamus) that are responsible for energy homeostasis.[17]</p>
	<p> Pulmonary stretch receptors are found in the lungs and control the respiratory rate.</p>
	<p> Peripheral chemoreceptors in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of suffocation if carbon dioxide levels get too high.[18]</p>
	<p> The chemoreceptor trigger zone is an area of the medulla in the brain that receives inputs from blood-borne drugs or hormones, and communicates with the vomiting center.</p>
	<p> Chemoreceptors in the circulatory system also measure salt levels and prompt thirst if they get too high; they can also respond to high sugar levels in diabetics.</p>
	<p> Cutaneous receptors in the skin not only respond to touch, pressure, temperature and vibration, but also respond to vasodilation in the skin such as blushing.</p>
	<p> Stretch receptors in the gastrointestinal tract sense gas distension that may result in colic pain.</p>
	<p> Stimulation of sensory receptors in the esophagus result in sensations felt in the throat when swallowing, vomiting, or during acid reflux.</p>
	<p> Sensory receptors in pharynx mucosa, similar to touch receptors in the skin, sense foreign objects such as food that may result in a gag reflex and corresponding gagging sensation.</p>
	<p> Stimulation of sensory receptors in the urinary bladder and rectum may result in sensations of fullness.</p>
	<p> Stimulation of stretch sensors that sense dilation of various blood vessels may result in pain, for example headache caused by vasodilation of brain arteries.</p>
	<p> Cardioception refers to the perception of the activity of the heart.</p>
	<p> Perception not based on a specific sensory organ[edit]</p>
	<p> Time[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: time perception</p>
	<p> Chronoception refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time,[19][20] composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.</p>
	<p> One or more dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system appear to have a strong modulatory influence on mental chronometry, particularly interval timing.[21]</p>
	<p> Agency[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Sense of agency</p>
	<p> The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, can lead to a loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.[22]</p>
	<p> Even in non-pathological cases, there is a measurable difference between making a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as the Libet experiment, a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.</p>
	<p> There are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In Wegner and Wheatley 1999, subjects were given instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person — acting as a test subject but actually a confederate — had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement. Experimenters were able to arrange for subjects to perceive certain "forced stops" as if they were their own choice.[23][24]</p>
	<p> Familiarity[edit]</p>
	<p> Recognition memory is sometimes divided into two functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection.[25] A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the sense of familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15 Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40 Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar.[26] Specifically, stimulation at 30–40 Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.[27]</p>
	<p> Non-human senses[edit]</p>
	<p> Analogous to human senses[edit]</p>
	<p> Other living organisms have receptors to sense the world around them, including many of the senses listed above for humans. However, the mechanisms and capabilities vary widely.</p>
	<p> Smell[edit]</p>
	<p> Most non-human mammals have a much keener sense of smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of smell in non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine the direction of a smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell.[28] Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.</p>
	<p> Vomeronasal organ[edit]</p>
	<p> Many animals (salamanders, reptiles, mammals) have a vomeronasal organ[29] that is connected with the mouth cavity. In mammals it is mainly used to detect pheromones of marked territory, trails, and sexual state. Reptiles like snakes and monitor lizards make extensive use of it as a smelling organ by transferring scent molecules to the vomeronasal organ with the tips of the forked tongue. In reptiles the vomeronasal organ is commonly referred to as Jacobsons organ. In mammals, it is often associated with a special behavior called flehmen characterized by uplifting of the lips. The organ is vestigial in humans, because associated neurons have not been found that give any sensory input in humans.[30]</p>
	<p> Taste[edit]</p>
	<p> Flies and butterflies have taste organs on their feet, allowing them to taste anything they land on. Catfish have taste organs across their entire bodies, and can taste anything they touch, including chemicals in the water.[31]</p>
	<p> Vision[edit]</p>
	<p> Cats have the ability to see in low light, which is due to muscles surrounding their irides–which contract and expand their pupils–as well as to the tapetum lucidum, a reflective membrane that optimizes the image. Pit vipers, pythons and some boas have organs that allow them to detect infrared light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The common vampire bat may also have an infrared sensor on its nose.[32] It has been found that birds and some other animals are tetrachromats and have the ability to see in the ultraviolet down to 300 nanometers. Bees and dragonflies[33] are also able to see in the ultraviolet. Mantis shrimps can perceive both polarized light and multispectral images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.[34]</p>
	<p> Balance[edit]</p>
	<p> Many invertebrates have a statocyst, which is a sensor for acceleration and orientation that works very differently from the mammalian's semi-circular canals.</p>
	<p> Sensing gravity[edit]</p>
	<p> Some plants (such as mustard) have genes that are necessary for the plant to sense the direction of gravity. If these genes are disabled by a mutation, a plant cannot grow upright.[35]</p>
	<p> Not analogous to human senses[edit]</p>
	<p> In addition, some animals have senses that humans do not, including the following:</p>
	<p> Echolocation[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Animal echolocation</p>
	<p> Certain animals, including bats and cetaceans, have the ability to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.</p>
	<p> Blind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as human echolocation.</p>
	<p> Electroreception[edit]</p>
	<p> Electroreception (or electroception) is the ability to detect electric fields. Several species of fish, sharks, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the Ampullae of Lorenzini. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social communication. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.</p>
	<p> The only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the dolphin and monotreme orders. Among these mammals, the platypus[36] has the most acute sense of electroception.</p>
	<p> A dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in vibrissal crypts arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.[37] These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.</p>
	<p> Body modification enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense.[38] However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.</p>
	<p> Magnetoception[edit]</p>
	<p> Magnetoception (or magnetoreception) is the ability to detect the direction one is facing based on the Earth's magnetic field. Directional awareness is most commonly observed in birds, which rely on their magnetic sense to navigate during migration.[39][39][40][41][42] It has also been observed in insects such as bees. Cattle make use of magnetoception to align themselves in a north-south direction.[43] Magnetotactic bacteria build miniature magnets inside themselves and use them to determine their orientation relative to the Earth's magnetic field.[44][45]</p>
	<p> Hygroreception[edit]</p>
	<p> Hygroreception is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.[46][47]</p>
	<p> Infrared sensing[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Infrared sensing in snakes</p>
	<p> The ability to sense infrared thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of snakes. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to "see" radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.[48] It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.[49] The facial pit underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.[50] The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril (Loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target endothermic prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.</p>
	<p> In spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors – while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.[51] This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original "resting" or "inactive" temperature.[51]</p>
	<p> Other[edit]</p>
	<p> Pressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the gas bladder to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the weather fish and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.</p>
	<p> Current detection is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of vortices, found in the lateral line of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are hair cells, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the electrical sense are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.</p>
	<p> Polarized light direction/detection is used by bees to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. Cuttlefish can also perceive the polarization of light. Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called Haidinger's brush, however this is considered an entoptic phenomenon rather than a separate sense.</p>
	<p> Slit sensillae of spiders detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.</p>
	<p> Plant senses[edit]</p>
	<p> By using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, gravity, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as functionalism and computationalism.</p>

	<p> Lairesse's Allegory of the Five Senses</p>
	<p> In the time of William Shakespeare, there were commonly reckoned to be five wits or five senses.[52] At that time, the words "sense" and "wit" were synonyms,[52] so the senses were known as the five outward wits.[53][54] This traditional concept of five senses is common today.</p>
	<p> The traditional five senses are enumerated as the "five material faculties" (pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ avakanti) in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the Katha Upanishad (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the "chariot" of the body, guided by the mind as "chariot driver".</p>
	<p> Depictions of the five traditional senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters. A typical example is Gérard de Lairesse's Allegory of the Five Senses (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a convex mirror, hearing is the cupid-like boy with a triangle, smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.</p>`

	eArt: `Science, as a philosophical concept, means the clear and certain knowledge of something, whether founded on self-evident principles, or via systematic demonstration.
	<p> The word science is, in this sense, the opposite of doubt; opinion stands midway between science and doubt.</p>
	<p> Skeptics deny the possibility of a science of anything; in other words, according to skeptics, there's nothing about which we can have certain knowledge.</p>
	<p> Science is divided into four branches: intelligence, wisdom, prudence and art.</p>
	<p> Intelligence is constituted by the mind's intuitive perception of the felicitous accord, or lack thereof, between two ideas; such as that of the science of God, and that of the knowledge we have of first principles.</p>
	<p> Wisdom is always striving for generalities, and is only interested in the relations between beings in order to arrive at universal truths. Spiritual beings are also part of wisdom's scope.</p>
	<p> Prudence's aim is to form habits of honesty consonant with eternal and immutable laws. In schools, this is called, habitus verâ cum ratione activus.</p>
	<p> Art confers fail-free rules that allow one to reason well. In school, it is defined as habitus verâ cum ratione effectivus.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.</p>
	<p> Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences, which study the material universe; the social sciences, which study people and societies; and the formal sciences, which study logic and mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations. Disciplines which use science, like engineering and medicine, may also be considered to be applied sciences.</p>
	<p> From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now, and in the Western world the term "natural philosophy" once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as astronomy, medicine, and physics. However, during the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham in his Book of Optics. While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.</p>
	<p> In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of physical laws. Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was during this time that scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, and physics reached their modern shapes. That same time period also included the origin of the terms "scientist" and "scientific community", the founding of scientific institutions, and the increasing significance of their interactions with society and other aspects of culture.</p>
	<p> The scale of the universe mapped to the branches of science, with formal sciences as the foundation.: Vol.1, Chaps.1,2,&3.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<p> Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations. Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.</p>
	<p> Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Antiquity</h3>
	<p> Before the invention or discovery of the concept of "nature" (ancient Greek phusis) by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural "way" in which a plant grows, and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish "nature" and "convention.": p.209 Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek technē) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans. A clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical science (doxa) was made by the pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BCE). Although his work Peri Physeos (On Nature) is a poem, it may be viewed as an epistemological essay on method in natural science. Parmenides' ἐὸν may refer to a formal system or calculus which can describe nature more precisely than natural languages. "Physis" may be identical to ἐὸν.</p>
	<p> A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, however, so Socrates was executed as a heretic.: 30e Aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy which was teleological and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science.</p>
	<p> Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the "theoretical" steps of deducing universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Medieval science</h3>
	<p> During late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "natural philosophy" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville. In the Byzantine empire, many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites. Many of these were later on translated into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon.</p>
	<p> The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq. It is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim scholars such as al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the Mongol sack of Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham, known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint by emphasizing experimental data.</p>
	<p> In the later medieval period, as demand for translations grew (for example, from the Toledo School of Translators), western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. In particular, the texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. In Europe, the Latin translation of Alhazen's Book of Optics directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century) in England, who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by Alhazen. By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism was flourishing in western Europe, which had become a new geographic center of science, but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Renaissance and early modern science</h3>
	<p> Medieval science carried on the views of the Hellenist civilization of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book from Ibn Abi Usaibia's catalog, as cited in (Smith 2001).:91(vol.1),p.xv Alhazen conclusively disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but he retained Aristotle's ontology; Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's Book of Optics, a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle. This model of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.</p>
	<p> A. Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision, which pivots on three of Aristotle's four causes, formal, material, and final, "is remarkably economical, reasonable, and coherent." Although Alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted, he argued that vision is about perception. This was overturned by Kepler,:p.102 who modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted.</p>
	<p> Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's Almagest.</p>
	<p> Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems," which greatly offended him.</p>
	<p> In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "formal cause," of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing "laws of nature". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Age of Enlightenment</h3>
	<p> In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as classical mechanics, which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "energy" and "potential" (modern versions of Aristotelian "energeia and potentia"). In the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature — coming close in meaning to the old term "natural philosophy."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> 19th century</h3>
	<p> Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist. When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the idea of atoms. The laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> 20th century and beyond</h3>
	<p> A simulated event in the CMS detector of the Large Hadron Collider, featuring a possible appearance of the Higgs boson</p>
	<p> Einstein's theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.</p>
	<p> In the first half of the century, the development of artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "atomic energy" (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race, all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science.</p>
	<p> Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones.</p>
	<p> More recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature. For example, in his book Consilience, E. O. Wilson said: "The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences".:334</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Scientific method</h3>
	<p> The scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way. An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "Occam's Razor") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena. This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).</p>
	<p> When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded. If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.</p>
	<p> While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias. This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be. Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Mathematics and formal sciences</h3>
	<p> Mathematics is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. For example, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including "pure" areas such as number theory and topology.</p>
	<p> Statistical methods, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.</p>
	<p> Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.</p>
	<p> A great amount of interest was taken in the study of formal logic in the early 20th century among mathematicians and philosophers with the rise of set theory and its use for the foundations of mathematics. Notable mathematicians and philosophers who contributed to this field include: Gottlob Frege, Giuseppe Peano, George Boole, Ernst Zermelo, Abraham Fraenkel, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred Whitehead among many others. Various axiomatic systems such as Peano arithmetic, the Zermelo–Fraenkel system of set theory, as well as the system in Principia Mathematica, were thought by many to prove the foundations of math. However, in 1931, with the publication of Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, much of their efforts were undermined. Formal logic is still studied today at universities by students of mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. For example, boolean algebra is employed by all modern computers to function, and thus is an extremely useful branch of knowledge for programmers.</p>
	<p> Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Scientific community</h4>
	<p> The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Branches and fields</h3>
	<p> The somatosensory system is located throughout our bodies but is integrated in the brain.</p>
	<p> Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These are both empirical sciences, which means their knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions. There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.</p>
	<p> Mathematics, which is classified as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).</p>
	<p> Apart from its broad meaning, the word "science" sometimes may specifically refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering, each of which is an applied science.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Institutions</h3>
	<p> Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period. The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei which was established in 1603. The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in 1660 and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666.</p>
	<p> International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Literature</h3>
	<p> An enormous range of scientific literature is published. Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500. The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.</p>
	<p> Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.</p>
	<p> Science magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.</p>
	<p> Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Science and society</h4>
	<h3> Women in science</h3>
	<p> Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions. Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work. For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a PhD program as "C. Ladd"; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.</p>
	<p> In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.: 258–261. In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women earned 50.3% bachelor's degrees, 45.6% master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields: Psychology (about 70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology (about 50-60%). However, when it comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math, Engineering, and Computer Science, women earned less than half the degrees. However, lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues, and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Science policy</h3>
	<p> Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.</p>
	<p> State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. In Great Britain, governmental approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and state funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."</p>
	<p> Science and technology research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP. In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Media perspectives</h3>
	<p> The mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Political usage</h3>
	<p> Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.</p>
	<p> John Horgan, Chris Mooney, and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas. Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described "feel-good fallacies" used in politics, especially on the left, where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs.: Vol. 78, No. 1. 2–38</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Science and the public</h3>
	<p> Various activities are developed to facilitate communication between the general public and science/scientists, such as science outreach, public awareness of science, science communication, science festivals, citizen science, science journalism, public science, and popular science. See Science and the public for related concepts.</p>
	<p> Science is represented by the 'S' in STEM fields.</p>

	<h4> Philosophy of science</h4>
	<p> Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.</p>
	<p> The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality. In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.</p>
	<p> There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.:p236</p>
	<p> Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.:p20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.:pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.:p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error. It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.</p>
	<p> Another approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed "shut up and multiply," emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena. It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.</p>
	<p> Paul Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism, which holds that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion, magic, and mythology, and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos) that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space.</p>
	<p> Finally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like "creation science" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations. That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena. The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Certainty and science</h3>
	<p> A scientific theory is empirical and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism. The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.":p4</p>
	<p> New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.:119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered factual. Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for "knowledge" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically, then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth. The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense. He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.</p>
	<p> Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is the cause of...", but rather "What are the most significant causes of...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).:141–147 Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.:141–147 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science</h3>
	<p> An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science. Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term "cargo cult science" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated. Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.</p>
	<p> There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science," research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "scientific misconduct" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Scientific practice</h4>
	<p> Astronomy became much more accurate after Tycho Brahe devised his scientific instruments for measuring angles between two celestial bodies, before the invention of the telescope. Brahe's observations were the basis for Kepler's laws.</p>
	<p> Although encyclopedias such as Pliny's (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger Bacon, Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as "affirming the consequent."</p>
	<p> "If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."</p>
	<p> — Francis Bacon, "The Advancement of Learning", Book 1, v, 8</p>
	<p> The methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands of years, and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.</p>
	<p> John Ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.:p44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility.":p46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.:p104</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Basic and applied research</h3>
	<p> Anthropogenic pollution has an effect on the Earth's environment and climate</p>
	<p> Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question "what is the use of basic research?" he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?". For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.:106–110 In a nutshell, basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Research in practice</h3>
	<p> Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well-funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals. D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Slavery is the establishment of a right founded on force which renders one man property to another man, who is absolute master of his life, his goods, and his liberty.</p>
	<p> This definition applies almost equally to civil slavery , and to political slavery : in order to sketch its origin, nature, and foundation, I will borrow many things from the author of l’Esprit des lois, without stopping at borrowing the sturdiness of his principles, because I can add nothing to his glory.</p>
	<p> All men are born free; in the beginning they only had one name, one condition. In the times of Saturn and of Rhea, according to Plutarch, there were neither masters nor slaves, nature made them all equal. But this natural equality was gradually set aside and servitude was introduced by degrees, probably founded originally on free contracts, although necessity must have been its source and origin.</p>
	<p> When, as a necessary result of the multiplication of the human race, we began to leave behind the simplicity of previous centuries, we sought new means of increasing leisure, and of acquiring surplus goods. There is much evidence that rich men hired the poor to work for them in exchange for a fixed wage. This resource having appeared very useful to both of them, several among them resolved to ensure their state and to enter permanently on the same footing into another’s family, on condition that he furnish food and all other necessities of life. Thus servitude was originally formed by free consent, and by a contract of labor in exchange for goods: do ut fascias. This arrangement was limited to certain things, according to the laws of each country, and the contracts of the interested parties. In essence, such slaves were only properly servitors or mercenaries, similar enough to our domestic servants.</p>
	<p> But we didn’t stay that way for long; we found too much advantage in having someone else do that which we would have been obliged to do ourselves. As we sought to expand forces under arms, we established the custom of granting to prisoners of war life and bodily liberty, on condition that they serve forever in the capacity of slaves those into whose hands they had fallen.</p>
	<p> As one maintains some residual animosity toward the unfortunates whom one reduced to slavery through force of arms, they were ordinarily treated with much rigor. Cruelty seemed excusable toward people at whose hands one had risked the same fate; it is thus easy to imagine being able to kill such slaves with impunity, as a result of anger or for the slightest error.</p>
	<p> This license having once been authorized, it was extended under an even less plausible pretext to those who were born from these slaves, and even to those purchased or acquired in some other manner. Thus servitude came to be naturalized, so to speak, through the lot of war. Those whom fortune favored, and who were left in the state in which nature had created them, were called free. By contrast, those whom weakness and misfortune had subjected to the victors, were called slaves. The philosopher-judges of the merit of men’s actions regard as charitable the conduct of this victor who enslaves his vanquished instead of ending his life.</p>
	<p> Slavery was introduced by the law of the strongest, that law of war in offense of nature, and by ambition, thirst for conquest, love of domination and apathy. To the shame of humanity, it has been accepted by almost all of the world’s peoples. Indeed, we could hardly cast our eyes on sacred History without discovering the horrors of servitude. The profane histories of the Greeks, of the Romans, and of all the other peoples who are considered civilized, are all monuments to this ancient injustice exercised with more or less violence across the face of the world, in all times, places, and nations.</p>
	<p> There are two kinds of slavery or servitude, real and personal: real servitude includes the slave in the value of land; personal servitude concerns the care of the house, and relates more to the person of the master. The extreme abuse of slavery is when it is at once personal and real. Such was the servitude of foreigners among the Jews, against whom they practiced the harshest treatments. Moses cried in vain to them: “you will not have full dominion over your slaves; you will not oppress them.” His exhortations never succeeded in alleviating the hardness of his ferocious nation, so he strove through his laws to find a remedy.</p>
	<p> He began by fixing the term of enslavement, and by ordering that it could only endure until the Jubilee year for foreigners, and for Hebrews only for six years (Leviticus 25:39).</p>
	<p> One of the principle reasons for his institution of the Sabbath was to obtain relief for servants and slaves (Exodus 20 and 23, Deuteronomy 16).</p>
	<p> He then decreed that no one could sell his own liberty, unless he was reduced to absolutely no livelihood. He mandated that when slaves purchased themselves, their past service had to be accounted for, just as when revenues already realized from sold land were counted in the price of purchase, the former proprietor recovered them. Deuteronomy, chapter xv. Leviticus, chapter xxv.</p>
	<p> If a master put out an eye or broke a tooth of his slave (and even more so, of course, if he did something worse), the slave should have his freedom in restitution for this loss.</p>
	<p> Another of this legislator’s laws holds that if a master strikes his slave, and the slave dies under the rod, the master must be punished as guilty of homicide: although it is true that the law adds that if the slave lives one or two days, the master is exempt from the penalty. The reason for this law was perhaps that when the slave did not die in the field, one could presume that the master did not intend to kill him; and thus that he could be seen as punished enough in having lost the slave’s value or the service that he would have gotten from him: at least this is what we are led to believe by the commentary on the text, because the slave is his money.</p>
	<p> Anyway, it was a very unusual nation, according to M. de Montesquieu, where civil law loosened natural law. That’s not what Saint Paul thought about this issue, when, preaching the enlightenment of the Gospel, he offered this principle of nature and of religion that should be deeply engraved in the hearts of all men: Masters (Letter to Colossians, iv, 1), render to your slaves that which the law and equity demand of you, knowing that you have a master in heaven; that is to say a master that pays no mind to these distinctions of conditions, forged by pride and injustice.</p>
	<p> The Lacedemonians were the first in Greece who would introduce the use of slaves, or who first reduced to servitude the Greeks that they had made prisoners of war: they would go even further (and I regret very much that I cannot pull the curtain on this part of their history), they treated their Helots with every last barbarity. These peoples, inhabitants of Spartan territory, having been vanquished during their revolt by the Spartans, were condemned to perpetual slavery , with prohibitions against their masters freeing them or selling them outside the land: thus the Helots found themselves subjected to all of the work outside of the house, and all sorts of insults inside the house. Their misfortune extended to the point that they were not only the slaves of a citizen, but of also of the public. Many peoples only experienced real slavery , because their women and children did domestic work. Other peoples experienced personal slavery , because luxury demanded service of slaves in the house; but here we find in the same individuals both real and personal slavery.</p>
	<p> It was not the same among the other peoples of Greece; slavery there was extremely gentle, and even the slaves most rudely treated by their masters could ask to be sold to someone else. We learn this from Plutarch, De superstitione , p. 66. t. I., édition de Wechel.</p>
	<p> The Athenians in particular, reports Xenophon, dealt with their slaves with much gentleness: they punished severely, sometimes even with death, those who beat the slave of another. The law of Athens, rightly, did not want to add loss of security to that of liberty; likewise, we do not find that slaves disturbed this republic, as they shook Lacedaemon.</p>
	<p> It is easy to see that only humanity exercised toward slaves can prevent, in a moderate government, the dangers that one fears from their too great numbers. Men become accustomed to servitude, provided that their master is not harder than their servitude: nothing more fully confirms this truth, than the state of slaves among the Romans during the beautiful days of the republic; consideration of this state deserves our attention for a few moments.</p>
	<p> The first Romans treated their slaves with more goodness than had any other people: the masters regarded them as their companions; they lived, worked, and ate with them. The greatest chastisement that they inflicted on a slave who had committed some fault was to attach a forked rod to his back or his chest, to extend his arms to the two ends of the fork, and to lead him about in public places; this was an ignominious penalty, and nothing more so: morals sufficed to maintain the slaves’ fidelity.</p>
	<p> Far from preventing by the force of law the multiplication of these living, animated economic organs, on the contrary they favored it with all of their might, and joined them with a kind of marriage called contuberniis. In this manner they filled their houses with domestics of both sexes and populated the state with innumerable people. The children of slaves eventually composed the fortune of their master, born in trust around him; he alone was charged with their upkeep and their education. The fathers, freed from this burden, followed the inclinations of nature, and reproduced without fear of a large family. They saw without jealousy a happy society, of which they regarded themselves as members. They believed that their soul could be elevated like that of their master, and they did not sense the difference that existed between the condition of a slave and that of a free man. It was often the case that generous masters taught exercises, music, and Greek letters to those among their slaves who showed talents; Terence and Phaedra are very good examples of this kind of education.</p>
	<p> The republic created for itself an infinite advantage in this nation of slaves, or rather of subjects: each of them had their peculium , that is to say his small treasure, his small fund, that he possessed on conditions that his master determined. With this peculium he worked on the side according to his talents; this one established a bank, that one devoted himself to the sea trade; one sold retail merchandise, the other applied himself to some mechanical art, leasing or adding value to land. There were none who weren’t devoted to making grow their peculium , which simultaneously procured an easing of present servitude and the hope of future liberty. All these means spread abundance, animating the arts and industry.</p>
	<p> These slaves, once enriched, freed themselves and became citizens; the republic renewed itself ceaselessly, and received into its heart new families at the rate that the ancients destroyed each other. Such were the good days of slavery , as long as the Romans preserved their morals and their integrity.</p>
	<p> But when expanded through their conquests and their plunder, such that their slaves were no longer their companions in their works, and that they used them to become the instruments of their luxury and their pride, the condition of the slaves changed its complexion entirely. They came to be regarded as the most vile part of the nation, and in consequence no one had any scruples about treating them inhumanely. Because Romans no longer had any morals, they had recourse to laws, which had to be terrible to establish the safety of these cruel masters, living in the midst of their slaves as if in the middle of their enemies.</p>
	<p> Under Augustus, which is to say at the beginning of the tyranny, the Syllanien senatorial decree and several other laws were passed that ordained that if a master were to be killed, all of the slaves who were under the same roof or in a place close enough to the house to be able to hear a man’s voice, would be condemned to death. Those who in this case hid a slave to save him would be punished like the murderers. Even those whose master had ordered them to kill him and who had obeyed would be held culpable: he who had not prevented the murder himself would be punished. If a master were killed on a voyage, those who had remained with him were killed as well as those who had fled: we should add that this master, during his life, could kill with impunity his slaves and also torture them. It is true that subsequently there were emperors who mitigated this power. Claudius ordered that ill slaves who were abandoned by their masters would be free if they returned to health. This law assured their liberty in a rare case; it should as well have served to ensure their life, as M. de Montesquieu said so well.</p>
	<p> Furthermore, all of these cruel laws that we’ve just described were used even against slaves whose innocence was proven. The laws didn’t depend on civil government, they depended on a vice of civil government. They did not derive from the equity of civil laws, since they were contrary to their principles. They were properly founded on the principle of war, except that in this case the enemies were in the heart of the state. The Syllanien senatorial decree derived, it is said, from the law of nations, which intends that even an imperfect society preserve itself: but a prudent legislator foresees the ill consequences of rendering the legislature terrible. The slaves amongst the Romans could have no confidence in the laws; and therefore the laws could have none in them. In the end the barbarous treatment of the slaves was pushed so far, that it produced the civil war that Florus compared to the Punic wars, and which by its violence shook the Roman Empire to its foundations.</p>
	<p> I like to dream that there are still on the earth happy climes whose inhabitants are sweet, tender, and compassionate: such are the Indians of the sub-continent, on this side of the Ganges; they treat their slaves as they treat themselves; they take care of their infants; they marry them and easily give them liberty. In general the slaves of simple working peoples, among whom reigns simplicity of manners, are more happy than everywhere else; they only suffer real slavery , which is less hard for them and more useful for their masters: such were the slaves of the ancient Germans. These peoples, Tacitus said, did not hold them as we do in their houses to make them work there each at a certain task, on the contrary they assigned to each slave his own manor, in which he lived as the father of the family. The only servitude that the master imposed upon him was the obligation to pay a tax in grain, in livestock, in skins, or in fabric: in this manner, the historian adds, you could not distinguish the master from the slave by the pleasures of life.</p>
	<p> When they conquered the Gauls, under the name Franks, they would send their slaves to cultivate the lands that thus fell to them: the slaves were called the people of the poet, in Latin gentes potestatis , attached to the land, addicti gleboe [serfs of the land]; and it is from among these serfs that France was thereafter populated. Their multiplication created almost as many villages as there were cultivated farms, and these lands retain the city names that the Romans gave them, and from which came the names village and villains, in Latin villa and villani , to designate the people of the country and of low extraction. One thus sees in France two kinds of slaves, those of the Franks and those of the Gauls, and all went to war, as has been said by M. de Boulainvilliers.</p>
	<p> These slaves belonged to their patrons, of whom they were considered to be body men, as it was said then: they became in time subject to rough duties and so attached to the land of their masters that they seemed to be a part of it, such that they could not move elsewhere, nor marry onto the land of another lord without paying what one would call the right of fors-mariage  ; and even the children who came from the union of two slaves of different masters were shared, or one of the patrons, to avoid such division, would give another slave in exchange.</p>
	<p> A military government where authority is divided among several lords inevitably degenerates into tyranny. This did not fail to happen: the ecclesiastical patrons and the lay patrons everywhere abused their power over their slaves; they weakened theme with too much work, taxes, chores, and with too much ill-treatment. Eventually the unhappy serfs, no longer able to tolerate the heaviness of the yoke, in 1108 staged the famous revolt described by the historians, which ended finally in the attainment of their freedom. Our kings had previously tried without success to soften the state of slavery through their laws.</p>
	<p> Meanwhile Christianity, beginning to gain currency, embraced the most humane sentiments; then our sovereigns, determined to weaken the lords and to free the common people from the yoke of their power, took the side of freeing the slaves. Louis the Fat set the example and in freeing the serfs in 1135 he partly succeeded in reclaiming over his vassals the authority they had previously captured: Louis VIII signaled the beginning of his reign by a similar liberation in 1223; finally Louis X called Hutin [the Quarreler], delivered an edict on this subject that seems to us worthy of being reproduced here:</p>
	<p> “Louis, by the grace of God, king of France and of Navarre: to our beloved and loyal supporters... as according to the law of nature each must be born free.... We, considering that our kingdom is called and named the kingdom of the Franks, and desiring that the thing in truth should be recognized in name... by deliberation with our grand council, have ordained and do ordain that generally throughout our realm freedom be given in good and valid conditions and so that all the lords who have body men take our example to make them free, etc. Promulgated at Paris the third of July, year of grace 1315.”</p>
	<p> Nevertheless it was not until almost the fifteenth century that slavery was abolished in the majority of Europe: meanwhile it remains in much of Poland, in Hungary, in Bohemia, and in several places in lower Germany; see Les ouvrages de MM. Thomasius et Hertins: there are even some traces in our customs, see Coquille. In any case, practically in the space of the century that followed the abolition of slavery in Europe, the Christian powers having made conquests in lands where they believed it in their interest to have slaves, permitted them to be bought and sold, having forgotten the principles of Nature and of Christianity, which render all men equal.</p>
	<p> After having reviewed the history of slavery , from its origin to our days, we now will prove that it damages the liberty of man and that it is contrary to natural and civil law, that it offends the structures of the best governments, and that finally it is useless in and of itself.</p>
	<p> The liberty of man is a principle which had been recognized for a long time before the birth of J.C. by all of the nations which have practiced generosity. The natural liberty of man is to know no sovereign power on the earth, and to never be subjected to legislative authority of any kind, but to follow only the laws of Nature: liberty in society is to be submitted to a legislative power established by the consent of the community, and not to be subject to whim, to the inconstant, uncertain, and arbitrary will of a single man in particular.</p>
	<p> This liberty, by which one is never subjected to absolute power, is united so closely with the safekeeping of man, that it cannot be separated without destroying at the same time his safety and his life. Whoever attempts therefore to usurp absolute power over another, puts himself thereby in a state of war with him, such that the first can only regard the actions of the other as an obvious attempt upon his life. Indeed, from the moment that a man wants me to submit, despite myself, to his empire, I have reason to presume that if I fall into his hands, he will treat me according to his caprice and have no scruples against killing me when the whim takes him. Liberty is, so to speak, the bulwark of my safekeeping, and the foundation of all the other things that belong to me. Thus, he who, in the state of nature, wants to make me a slave authorizes me to resist by all means in order to ensure the security of my person and my goods.</p>
	<p> All men naturally having equal liberty and they cannot be stripped of it unless as a result of some criminal action. Certainly, if a man in the state of nature deserves death for something he has done to another man, who has as a result become the master of his life, the latter trade with him, and use him for service since he holds the guilty man’s life in his hands. In this he does no wrong, because in essence, when the criminal finds that his slavery is more heavy and more annoying than is the loss of his existence, he has it in his power to attain the death that he desires through resistance and disobedience to his master.</p>
	<p> What makes the death of a criminal in civil society a legitimate choice is that the law that punishes him has been made for his protection. A murderer, for example, has enjoyed the protection of the law that condemns him; it has protected his life in all instances; he can make no complaint against this law. It would not be the same with the law of slavery. The law that establishes slavery would in all cases be against the slave, without ever being for him, and is thus is contrary to the fundamental principle of all societies.</p>
	<p> The rights of property over men and over things are two very different rights. Although all lords say ‘this person here is mine’ of each who is submitted to his domination, the property he has in such a man is not the same as that which he can claim for himself when he says, ‘this thing here is mine.’ Property in a thing carries the full right to make use of it, to consume it, and to destroy it, whether for profit or by caprice; as a result, no matter in what manner one disposes of it, one does it no wrong. But the same expression applied to a person signifies only that the lord has a right, exclusive of others, to govern and to prescribe laws for that person, while at the same time he is himself is severally obligated to this same person; furthermore his power over that person is quite limited.</p>
	<p> However grand the injuries that one has received from a man, humanity does not permit, once one has reconciled with him, his reduction to a condition where there no longer remains any trace of the natural equality of all men and as a consequence his treatment as an animal of which one is the master to dispose of at one’s whim. Peoples who treated slaves as a goods which they could dispose of at will were nothing other than barbarians.</p>
	<p> Not only can one not have property as such in persons, but furthermore it offends reason that a man who has no power over his own life can give to another, either by his consent or by any convention, the right that he does not himself have. It is therefore not true that a free man can sell himself. A sale presupposes a price; when the slave sells himself, all his goods merge with the property of the master. Thus the master gives nothing, and the slave receives nothing. He would have a peculium , one might answer, but the peculium is attached to the person. The liberty of each citizen is a part of the public liberty: this quality, in a popular state is also a part of the sovereignty. If liberty has a price for the buyer, it is priceless for the seller.</p>
	<p> Civil law, which has allowed the division of goods among men, is not empowered to count among the number of goods a section of the men who take part in this division. Civil law, which makes restitution for contracts that contain injuries, cannot help but rectify an agreement that contains the most enormous injury of all. Slavery is therefore no less opposed to civil law than it is to natural law. What civil law could prevent a slave from saving himself from servitude, he who is not part of society and as a consequence is not bound by any civil law? He can only be detained by a law of the family, by the law of the master, that is to say by the law of the strongest.</p>
	<p> If slavery offends natural law and civil law, it injures as well the best forms of government: it is contrary to monarchical government, in which it is supremely important not to humble or debase human nature. In democracy, where everyone is equal and in aristocracy, where the laws must work so that everyone is as equal as the nature of government can permit, slaves are against the spirit of the constitution; they only serve to give citizens a power and a luxury which they should not have.</p>
	<p> Furthermore, in every government and in every country, no matter how punitive the work that the society there demands, everything can be done with free men by encouraging them through compensation and privileges, in apportioning their work to their capabilities, or in supplementing them with machines that art invents and applies according to needs and locales. See evidence in M. de Montesquieu.</p>
	<p> Finally we should further add with this illustrious author that slavery is not useful either for the master or for the slave: for the slave, because he can do nothing out of virtue; for the master, because he contracts with his slaves all kinds of vices and bad habits that are contrary to the laws of society. He unwittingly becomes accustomed to the lack of all moral virtues and he becomes proud, touchy, angry, hard, voluptuous, barbaric.</p>
	<p> Thus everything converges to leave to man the dignity which is natural to him. Everything cries out to us that one cannot deprive him of that natural dignity which is liberty. The rule of justice is not founded on power, but on that which conforms to nature. Slavery is not only a humiliating state for those who suffer it, but for humanity itself which is degraded by it.</p>
	<p> The principles just posed being unassailable, it will not be difficult to demonstrate that slavery can never be whitewashed on any reasonable grounds, not by the law of war, as thought the roman jurisconsults, by the law of acquisition, nor by that of birth, as some moderns have wanted to persuade us. In a word, nothing in the world can render slavery legitimate.</p>
	<p> In past centuries, the law of war was said to authorize that of slavery. According to it, prisoners were made slaves so that they would not be killed; but today we are disabused of this nicety, which consisted of making one’s vanquished one’s slave rather than massacring him. It is understood that this supposed charity is only that of a brigand, which glorifies him for having given life to those whom he has not killed. There is no longer anyone except the Tartars who put their prisoners of war to the sword, and who believe that they are pardoning them when they sell them or distribute them to their soldiers. Among all other peoples, those who have not been stripped of all generous sentiment, it is only permissible to kill in war in the case of necessity. From the time that one man makes another his prisoner, it can no longer be said that it is necessary to kill him since he did not do so originally. The only right that war can grant victors over captives is to be able to ensure that their own people are not in any danger.</p>
	<p> The acquisition of slaves by means of money can even less establish the right of slavery , because money and all it represents cannot grant the right to strip someone of his liberty. Furthermore, trafficking in slaves like brutal beasts in order to make a vile living is repulsive to our religion, which has emerged in order to efface all traces of tyranny.</p>
	<p> Slavery is certainly no better founded on birth. This claimed right falls with the other two, because if a man could not be bought or sold even less could he sell his unborn child. If a prisoner of war cannot be reduced to servitude, even less his child. In vain would one argue that if the children are conceived and put into the world by a slave mother, the master does them no wrong by claiming them and reducing them to the same condition, since the mother having nothing of her own, her children cannot be nourished except by means of the master before whom they are in a state of servitude and who supplies her with food and other necessities of life. These are only frivolous ideas.</p>
	<p> If it is absurd that a man could have over another man a right of property, all the more reason that he cannot have it over that man’s children. Moreover, nature gives milk to mothers and has provided sufficiently for their nourishment. The rest of their childhood is so close to the age when they are most capable of being useful, that one could say that he who feeds them in order to be their master gives them nothing. If he has furnished something for the support of the child, the object is so small that any man, however mediocre might be the faculties of his soul and his body, can in a small number of years earn enough to clear this debt. If slavery was founded on food, it would be reduced to those unable to earn their living, but we don’t find any slaves of that sort.</p>
	<p> There could be no justice in an agreement, overt or tacit, by which a slave mother would subject the children that she put into the world to the same condition in which she has fallen, because she cannot stipulate for her children.</p>
	<p> It has been said, in order to put this reason for enslaving children in a good light, that they would not exist if the master had wanted to use the right given him by war, to kill their mother. But this is to suppose that which is false, that all those who are taken in war (were it the most just in the world) above all the women in question, could legitimately be killed. Esprit des lois , liv. XV.</p>
	<p> It was a proud pretention of the Greeks to imagine that since the barbarians were slaves by nature (it was thus that they spoke of them), and the Greeks free, it was just that the first obey the latter. On these grounds, it would be easy to treat as barbarians all peoples whose morals and customs are different than ours and (without other pretext) to attack them in order to subject them to our laws. It is only prejudices of pride and of ignorance that make us renounce humanity.</p>
	<p> It is therefore to go directly against the law of nations and against nature to believe that the Christian religion gives those who profess it the right to reduce to servitude those who do not profess it, so as to work more easily for its propagation. It was however this manner of thinking that encouraged the destroyers of America in their crimes; and that is not the only time that religion has been utilized against its own maxims, which teach us that the status of fellow man applies universally.</p>
	<p> Finally, it is to play with words, or rather to mock them, to write as has one of our modern authors, that it is small-minded to imagine that it would degrade humanity to have slaves, because the liberty which each European is believed to enjoy is nothing other than the power to break his chain in order to take a new master; as if the chain of a European was the same as that of a slave in our colonies: we can well see that this author has never been put in chains.</p>
	<p> Nevertheless, are there no cases or locations where slavery derives from the nature of things? I respond 1) to this question, there are none; I respond next, with M. de Montesquieu, that if there are countries where slavery appears founded on a natural cause, it is those where heat enervates the body, and weakens courage so much that men are only brought to hard labor by fear of chastisement: in those countries, the master being as lax from the perspective of his prince as his slave is in his own view, civil slavery is still accompanied by political slavery.</p>
	<p> In arbitrary governments, it is easy to sell oneself, because there political slavery in some fashion annihilates civil liberty. At Achim, Dampier says, everyone seeks to sell himself: some of the principle lords have no fewer than a thousand slaves, who are themselves principle merchants, who have also many slaves below them, and they many others; they are inherited and traded. Free men there, being too weak against the government, seek to become the slaves of those who tyrannize the government.</p>
	<p> Note that in these despotic states, where one is already under political slavery , civil slavery is more tolerable than elsewhere: each is content enough to have his subsistence and his life. Thus the condition of the slave is hardly more to bear than the condition of the subject: the two conditions are adjacent. However although in these countries slavery is, as it were, founded on natural causes, it is no less true that slavery is against nature.</p>
	<p> In all Muslim states servitude is rewarded by the laziness which is allowed to the slaves that serve for pleasure. It is this laziness which renders the seraglios of the Orient places of delights for even those against whom they are made. Nations that fear only work can find their happiness in these tranquil places; but one sees that there even the goal of the establishment of slavery is betrayed. These last reflections are from de l’Esprit des lois.</p>
	<p> We conclude that slavery founded by force, by violence, and in certain climates by an excess of servitude, cannot maintain itself in the world except by the same means.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Slavery is, in the strictest sense of the term, any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property. A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, de jure slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against his or her will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour, to refer to such situations. However, and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word, slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs.</p>
	<p> Slavery began to exist before written history, in many cultures. A person could become a slave from the time of their birth, capture, or purchase.</p>
	<p> While slavery was institutionally recognized by most societies, it has now been outlawed in all recognized countries, the last being Mauritania in 2007. Nevertheless, there are still more slaves today than at any previous point in history: an estimated 45 million people remain enslaved worldwide. The most common form of the slave trade is now commonly referred to as human trafficking. Chattel slavery is also still practiced by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In other areas, slavery (or unfree labour) continues through practices such as debt bondage, serfdom, domestic servants kept in captivity, certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves, child soldiers, and forced marriage.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Terminology</h4>
	<p> The English word slave comes from Old French sclave, from the Medieval Latin sclavus, from the Byzantine Greek σκλάβος, which, in turn, comes from the ethnonym Slav, because in some early Medieval wars many Slavs were captured and enslaved. An older interpretation connected it to the Greek verb skyleúo 'to strip a slain enemy'.</p>
	<p> There is a dispute among historians about whether terms such as "unfree labourer" or "enslaved person", rather than "slave", should be used when describing the victims of slavery. According to those proposing a change in terminology, "slave" perpetuates the crime of slavery in language, by reducing its victims to a nonhuman noun instead of, according to Andi Cumbo-Floyd, "carry them forward as people, not the property that they were". Other historians prefer "slave" because the term is familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumanity of slavery, with "person" implying a degree of autonomy that slavery does not allow for.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Types</h4>
	<h3> Chattel slavery</h3>
	<p> Chattel slavery, also called traditional slavery, is so named because people are treated as the chattel (personal property) of the owner and are bought and sold as commodities. Although it dominated many societies in the past, this form of slavery has been formally abolished and is very rare today. Even when it can be said to survive, it is not upheld by the legal system of any internationally recognized government.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Bonded labour</h3>
	<p> Indenture, otherwise known as bonded labour or debt bondage is a form of unfree labour under which a person pledges himself or herself against a loan. The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their parents' debt. It is the most widespread form of slavery today. Debt bondage is most prevalent in South Asia.</p>

	<br>
	<h3> Forced labour</h3>
	<p> Forced labour, or unfree labour, is sometimes used to refer to when an individual is forced to work against his or her will, under threat of violence or other punishment but the generic term unfree labour is also used to describe chattel slavery, as well as any other situation in which a person is obliged to work against his or her will and a person's ability to work productively is under the complete control of another person. This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as serfdom, conscription and penal labour. While some unfree labourers, such as serfs, have substantive, de jure legal or traditional rights, they also have no ability to terminate the arrangements under which they work, are frequently subject to forms of coercion, such as threats of violence, and experience restrictions on their activities and movement outside their place of work.</p>
	<p> Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into prostitution. and is the fastest growing form of forced labour, with Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</p>
	<p> In 2007, Human Rights Watch estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children served as soldiers in current conflicts.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Forced marriage</h3>
	<p> A forced marriage may be regarded as a form of slavery by one or more of the parties involved in the marriage, as well as by people observing the marriage. People forced into marriage can be required to engage in sexual activity or to perform domestic duties or other work without any personal control. The customs of bride price and dowry that exist in many parts of the world can lead to buying and selling people into marriage. Forced marriage continues to be practiced in parts of the world including some parts of Asia and Africa. Forced marriages may also occur in immigrant communities in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. Marriage by abduction occurs in many places in the world today, with a national average of 69% of marriages in Ethiopia being through abduction.</p>
	<p> The International Labour Organization defines child and forced marriage as forms of modern-day slavery.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Dependents</p>
	<p> The word "slave" has also been used to refer to a legal state of dependency to somebody else. In many cases, such as in ancient Persia, the situation and lives of such slaves could be better than those of other common citizens.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Contemporary slavery</h4>
	<p> Even though slavery is now outlawed in every country, the number of slaves today is estimated as between 12 million and 29.8 million. Several estimates of the number of slaves in the world have been provided. According to a broad definition of slavery used by Kevin Bales of Free the Slaves (FTS), an advocacy group linked with Anti-Slavery International, there were 27 million people in slavery in 1999, spread all over the world. In 2005, the International Labour Organization provided an estimate of 12.3 million forced labourers. Siddharth Kara has also provided an estimate of 28.4 million slaves at the end of 2006 divided into three categories: bonded labour/debt bondage (18.1 million), forced labour (7.6 million), and trafficked slaves (2.7 million). Kara provides a dynamic model to calculate the number of slaves in the world each year, with an estimated 29.2 million at the end of 2009. According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, an estimated 15 million children in debt bondage in India work in slavery-like conditions to pay off their family's debts.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Distribution</h3>
	<p> A report by the Walk Free Foundation in 2013, found India had the highest number of slaves, nearly 14 million, followed by China (2.9 million), Pakistan (2.1 million), Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, Thailand, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Bangladesh; while the countries with the highest of proportion of slaves were Mauritania, Haiti, Pakistan, India and Nepal.</p>
	<p> In June 2013, U.S. State Department released a report on slavery, it placed Russia, China, Uzbekistan in the worst offenders category, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe were also at the lowest level. The list also included Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait among a total of 21 countries.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Economics</h3>
	<p> While American slaves in 1809 were sold for around $40,000 (in inflation adjusted dollars), a slave nowadays can be bought for just $90, making replacement more economical than providing long term care. Slavery is a multibillion-dollar industry with estimates of up to $35 billion generated annually.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Trafficking</h3>
	<p> Trafficking in human beings (also called human trafficking) is one method of obtaining slaves. Victims are typically recruited through deceit or trickery (such as a false job offer, false migration offer, or false marriage offer), sale by family members, recruitment by former slaves, or outright abduction. Victims are forced into a "debt slavery" situation by coercion, deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, threat, physical force, debt bondage or even force-feeding with drugs of abuse to control their victims. "Annually, according to U.S. government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80 percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors, reports the U.S. State Department in a 2008 study.</p>
	<p> While the majority of trafficking victims are women, and sometimes children, who are forced into prostitution (in which case the practice is called sex trafficking), victims also include men, women and children who are forced into manual labour. Due to the illegal nature of human trafficking, its exact extent is unknown. A U.S. government report published in 2005, estimates that 600,000 to 800,000 people worldwide are trafficked across borders each year. This figure does not include those who are trafficked internally. Another research effort revealed that between 1.5 million and 1.8 million individuals are trafficked either internally or internationally each year, 500,000 to 600,000 of whom are sex trafficking victims.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Examples</h3>
	<h2> Asia</h2>
	<p> In 2008, the Nepalese government abolished the Haliya system, under which 20,000 people were forced to provide free farm labour.</p>
	<p> Though slavery was officially abolished in Qing China in 1910, the practice continues unofficially in some regions of the country. In June and July 2007, 550 people who had been enslaved by brick manufacturers in Shanxi and Henan were freed by the Chinese government. Among those rescued were 69 children. In response, the Chinese government assembled a force of 35,000 police to check northern Chinese brick kilns for slaves, sent dozens of kiln supervisors to prison, punished 95 officials in Shanxi province for dereliction of duty, and sentenced one kiln foreman to death for killing an enslaved worker.</p>
	<p> The North Korean government operates six large political prison camps, where political prisoners and their families (around 200,000 people) in lifelong detention are subjected to hard slave labour, torture and inhumane treatment.</p>
	<p> In November 2006, the International Labour Organization announced it will be seeking "to prosecute members of the ruling Myanmar junta for crimes against humanity" over the continuous unfree labour of its citizens by the military at the International Court of Justice. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), an estimated 800,000 people are subject to forced labour in Myanmar.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> South America and Caribbean</h2>
	<p> In 2008, in Brazil about 5,000 slaves were rescued by government authorities as part of an initiative to eradicate slavery, which was reported as ongoing in 2010. Poverty has forced at least 225,000 Haitian children to work as restavecs (unpaid household servants); the United Nations considers this to be a form of slavery.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Middle East</h2>
	<p> Some tribal sheiks in Iraq still keep blacks, called Abd, which means servant or slave in Arabic, as slaves.</p>
	<p> According to media reports from late 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was selling Yazidi and Christian women as slaves. According to Haleh Esfandiari of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, after ISIL militants have captured an area "hey usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them." In mid-October 2014, the UN estimated that 5,000 to 7,000 Yazidi women and children were abducted by ISIL and sold into slavery. In the digital magazine Dabiq, ISIL claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women whom they consider to be from a heretical sect. ISIL claimed that the Yazidi are idol worshipers and their enslavement part of the old shariah practice of spoils of war. According to The Wall Street Journal, ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims "justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world".</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Africa</h2>
	<p> In Mauritania, the last country to abolish slavery (in 1981), it is estimated that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are enslaved with many used as bonded labour. Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007. (although slavery as a practice was legally banned in 1981, it was not a crime to own a slave until 2007). Although many slaves have escaped or have been freed since 2007, as of 2012, only one slave-owner had been sentenced to serve time in prison.</p>
	<p> An article in the Middle East Quarterly in 1999 reported that slavery is endemic in Sudan. Estimates of abductions during the Second Sudanese Civil War range from 14,000 to 200,000 people.</p>
	<p> In Niger, slavery is also a current phenomenon. A Nigerien study has found that more than 800,000 people are enslaved, almost 8% of the population. Niger installed anti slavery provision in 2003. In a landmark ruling in 2008, the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice declared that the Republic of Niger failed to protect Hadijatou Mani Koraou from slavery, and awarded Mani CFA 10,000,000 (approximately US$20,000) in reparations.</p>
	<p> Many pygmies in the Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo belong from birth to Bantus in a system of slavery.</p>
	<p> According to the U.S. State Department, more than 109,000 children were working on cocoa farms alone in Ivory Coast in "the worst forms of child labour" in 2002.</p>
	<p> On the night of 14–15 April 2014, a group of militants attacked the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Nigeria. They broke into the school, pretending to be guards, telling the girls to get out and come with them. A large number of students were taken away in trucks, possibly into the Konduga area of the Sambisa Forest where Boko Haram were known to have fortified camps. Houses in Chibok were also burned down in the incident. According to police, approximately 276 children were taken in the attack, of whom 53 had escaped as of 2 May. Other reports said that 329 girls were kidnapped, 53 had escaped and 276 were still missing. The students have been forced to convert to Islam and into marriage with members of Boko Haram, with a reputed "bride price" of ₦2,000 each ($12.50/£7.50). Many of the students were taken to the neighbouring countries of Chad and Cameroon, with sightings reported of the students crossing borders with the militants, and sightings of the students by villagers living in the Sambisa Forest, which is considered a refuge for Boko Haram.</p>
	<p> On May 5, 2014 a video in which Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau claimed responsibility for the kidnappings emerged. Shekau claimed that "Allah instructed me to sell them...I will carry out his instructions" and "lavery is allowed in my religion, and I shall capture people and make them slaves." He said the girls should not have been in school and instead should have been married since girls as young as nine are suitable for marriage.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> History</h4>
	<h3> Early history</h3>
	<p> Evidence of slavery predates written records, and has existed in many cultures. Slavery is rare among hunter-gatherer populations because it requires economic surpluses and a high population density to be viable. This, although it has existed among unusually resource-rich hunter gatherers, such as the American Indian peoples of the salmon-rich rivers of the Pacific Northwest Coast, slavery became widespread only with the invention of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution about 11,000 years ago.</p>
	<p> In the earliest known records, slavery is treated as an established institution. The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive. The Bible mentions slavery as an established institution.</p>
	<p> Slavery was known in almost every ancient civilization and society including Sumer, Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, the Hebrew kingdoms of the ancient Levant, and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas. Such institutions included debt-slavery, punishment for crime, the enslavement of prisoners of war, child abandonment, and the birth of slave children to slaves.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Classical antiquity</h3>
	<p> Records of slavery in Ancient Greece date as far back as Mycenaean Greece. It is certain that Classical Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC; two to four-fifths of the population were slaves. As the Roman Republic expanded outward, entire populations were enslaved, thus creating an ample supply from all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Greeks, Illyrians, Berbers, Germans, Britons, Thracians, Gauls, Jews, Arabs, and many more were slaves used not only for labour, but also for amusement (e.g. gladiators and sex slaves). This oppression by an elite minority eventually led to slave revolts (see Roman Servile Wars); the Third Servile War led by Spartacus (a Thracian) being the most famous and bitter.</p>
	<p> By the late Republican era, slavery had become a vital economic pillar in the wealth of Rome, as well as a very significant part of Roman society. It is estimated that 25% or more of the population of Ancient Rome was enslaved, although the actual percentage is debated by scholars, and varied from region to region. Slaves represented 15–25% of Italy's population, mostly captives in war especially from Gaul and Epirus. Estimates of the number of slaves in the Roman Empire suggest that the majority of slaves were scattered throughout the provinces outside of Italy. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher death rates and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Middle Ages</h3>
	<h2> Medieval and Early Modern Europe</h2>
	<p> Large-scale trading in slaves was mainly confined to the South and East of early medieval Europe: the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim world were the destinations, while pagan Central and Eastern Europe (along with the Caucasus and Tartary) were important sources. Viking, Arab, Greek, and Radhanite Jewish merchants were all involved in the slave trade during the Early Middle Ages. The trade in European slaves reached a peak in the 10th century following the Zanj rebellion which dampened the use of African slaves in the Arab world.</p>
	<p> Medieval Spain and Portugal were the scene of almost constant Muslim invasion of the predominantly Christian area. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. In raid against Lisbon, Portugal in 1189, for example, the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child captives, while his governor of Córdoba, in a subsequent attack upon Silves, Portugal in 1191, took 3,000 Christian slaves. From the 11th to the 19th century, North African Barbary Pirates engaged in Razzias, raids on European coastal towns, to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in places such as Algeria and Morocco.</p>
	<p> In Britain, slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of Rome and sections of Hywel the Good's laws dealt with slaves in medieval Wales. The trade particularly picked up after the Viking invasions, with major markets at Chester and Bristol supplied by Danish, Mercian, and Welsh raiding of one another's borderlands. At the time of the Domesday Book, nearly 10% of the English population were slaves. Slavery in early medieval Europe was so common that the Roman Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it — or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands was prohibited at e.g. the Council of Koblenz (922), the Council of London (1102) aimed mainly at the sale of English slaves to Ireland and having no legal standing), and the Council of Armagh (1171). In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any "Saracens (antiquated term referring to Muslims), pagans and any other unbelievers" to perpetual slavery, legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. However, Pope Paul III forbade enslavement of the Native Americans in 1537 in his papal bull Sublimus Dei. Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Native Americans. Along with other priests, they opposed their treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission.</p>
	<p> The Byzantine-Ottoman wars and the Ottoman wars in Europe brought large numbers of slaves into the Islamic world. To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire established a janissary system which seized hundreds of thousands of Christian boys through the devşirme system. They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were never bought or sold. The Empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the Battle of Lepanto, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the Ottoman fleet. Eastern Europe suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves into jasyr. Seventy-five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into Poland–Lithuania between 1474 and 1569.</p>
	<p> Approximately 10–20% of the rural population of Carolingian Europe consisted of slaves. Slavery largely disappeared from Western Europe by the later Middle Ages. The slave trade became illegal in England in 1102, but England went on to become very active in the lucrative Atlantic slave trade from the seventeenth to the early nineteenth century. In Scandinavia, thralldom was abolished in the mid-14th century. Slavery persisted longer in Eastern Europe. Slavery in Poland was forbidden in the 15th century; in Lithuania, slavery was formally abolished in 1588; they were replaced by the second serfdom. In Kievan Rus and Muscovy, slaves were usually classified as kholops.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> China</h2>
	<p> In the process of the Mongols invasion of China proper, many Han Chinese were enslaved by the Mongols. According to Japanese historian Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), there were also certain number of Mongolian slaves owned by Han Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. Moreover, there is no evidence that Han Chinese, who were considered people of the bottom of Yuan society by some research, were suffered a particularly cruel abuse. In the early Qing dynasty, many Han Chinese were enslaved by the Manchurian rulers, some of them found themselves in positions of power and influence in Manchu administrations and owned their own Han Chinese slaves.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Arab slave trade</h2>
	<p> In early Islamic states of the Western Sudan (present-day West Africa), including Ghana (750–1076), Mali (1235–1645), Segou (1712–1861), and Songhai (1275–1591), about a third of the population was enslaved.</p>
	<p> Slaves were purchased or captured on the frontiers of the Islamic world and then imported to the major centres, where there were slave markets from which they were widely distributed. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the black Zanj slaves may have constituted at least a half of the total population of lower Iraq. At the same time, many slaves in the region were also imported from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Many slaves were taken in the wars with the Christian nations of medieval Europe.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Africa</h2>
	<p> Slavery was also widespread in Africa, with both internal and external slave trade.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Modern history</h3>
	<h2> Europe</h2>
	<p> Until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate (a Muslim Tatar state) maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Poland-Lithuania and Russia over the period 1500–1700.</p>
	<p> During the Second World War (1939–1945) Nazi Germany effectively enslaved about 12 million people, both those considered undesirable and citizens of countries they conquered, with the avowed intention of treating these untermenschen as a permanent slave class of inferior beings who could be worked until they died but who possessed neither the rights nor the legal status of members of the Aryan race.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Ottoman Empire</h2>
	<p> The Ottoman Empire owned and traded slaves on a massive scale. Many slaves were the created by conquest and the suppression of rebellions, in the aftermath of which, entire populations were sometimes enslaved and sold across the Empire, reducing the risk of future rebellion. The Ottomans also purchased slaves from traders who brought slaves into the Empire from Europe and Africa.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Africa</h2>
	<p> In Algiers, the capital of Algeria, captured Christians and Europeans were forced into slavery. Raids by Barbary pirates on coastal villages and ships extending from Italy to Iceland, enslaved an estimated 1 million to 1¼ million Europeans between the 16th and 19th centuries. This eventually led to the bombardment of Algiers by an Anglo-Dutch fleet in 1816.</p>
	<p> Half the population of the Sokoto caliphate of the 19th century (based in the future northern Nigeria) were slaves. The Swahili-Arab slave trade reached its height about 160 years ago, when, for example, approximately 20,000 slaves were considered to be carried yearly from Nkhotakota on Lake Malawi to Kilwa. Roughly half the population of Madagascar was enslaved.</p>
	<p> According to the Encyclopedia of African History, "It is estimated that by the 1890s the largest slave population of the world, about 2 million people, was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate. The use of slave labour was extensive, especially in agriculture." The Anti-Slavery Society estimated there were 2 million slaves in Ethiopia in the early 1930s out of an estimated population of 8 to 16 million.</p>
	<p> Arab slave traders and their captives along the Ruvuma river (in today's Tanzania and Mozambique).</p>
	<p> Hugh Clapperton in 1824 believed that half the population of Kano were enslaved people. W. A. Veenhoven wrote: "The German doctor, Gustav Nachtigal, an eye-witness, believed that for every slave who arrived at a market three or four died on the way... Keltie (The Partition of Africa, London, 1920) believes that for every slave the Arabs brought to the coast at least six died on the way or during the slavers' raid. Livingstone puts the figure as high as ten to one."</p>
	<p> One of the most famous slave traders on the eastern Zanj (Bantu) coast was Tippu Tip, himself the grandson of a slave. The prazeros were slave-traders along the Zambezi. North of the Zambezi, the waYao and Makua people played a similar role as professional slave-raiders and -traders. Still further north were the Nyamwezi slave-traders.</p>

	<p> In Constantinople, about one-fifth of the population consisted of slaves. The city was a major centre of the slave trade in the 15th and later centuries. By 1475 most of the slaves were provided by Tatar raids on Slavic villages. It has been estimated that some 200,000 slaves—mainly Circassians—were imported into the Ottoman Empire between 1800 and 1909. As late as 1908, women slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire. A slave market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was centred in the Central Asian khanate of Khiva. In the early 1840s, the population of the Uzbek states of Bukhara and Khiva included about 900,000 slaves. Darrel P. Kaiser wrote, "Kazakh-Kirghiz tribesmen kidnapped 1573 settlers from colonies  in 1774 alone and only half were successfully ransomed. The rest were killed or enslaved."</p>
	<p> According to Sir Henry Bartle Frere (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8 or 9 million slaves in India in 1841. About 15% of the population of Malabar were slaves. Slavery was abolished in British India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843.</p>
	<p> In East Asia, the Imperial government formally abolished slavery in China in 1906, and the law became effective in 1910. The Nangzan in Tibetan history were, according to Chinese sources, hereditary household slaves.</p>
	<p> In the Joseon period of Korea, members of the slave class were known as nobi. The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen other than the ruling yangban class, and some possessed property rights, legal entities and civil rights. Hence, some scholars argue that it's inappropriate to call them "slaves", while some scholars describe them as serfs. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated, and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5 percent of the total population of Korea. The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the Gabo Reform of 1894, but traces remained until 1930.</p>
	<p> In late 16th century Japan, slavery as such was officially banned, but forms of contract and indentured labour persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labour.</p>
	<p> The hill tribe people in Indochina were "hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Anamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians". A Siamese military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been "transformed into slave-hunting raids on a large scale". The census, taken in 1879, showed that 6% of the population in the Malay sultanate of Perak were slaves. Enslaved people made up about two-thirds of the population in part of North Borneo in the 1880s.</p>
	<p> Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the Yi people (also known as Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu including Han people. The descendants of the Han Chinese slaves are the White Yi (白彝) and they outnumber the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one. As much as tens of thousands of Han slaves were incorporated into Nuosu society every year. The Han slaves and their offspring were used for manual labor. There is a saying goes like: "the worst insult to a Nuosu is to call him a "Han" (with the implication being that "your ancestors were slaves")".</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Americas</h2>
	<p> Slavery in the Americas had a contentious history, and played a major role in the history and evolution of some countries, triggering at least one revolution and one civil war, as well as numerous rebellions. The Aztecs had slaves. Other Amerindians, such as the Inca of the Andes, the Tupinambá of Brazil, the Creek of Georgia, and the Comanche of Texas, also owned slaves.</p>
	<p> The maritime town of Lagos was the first slave market created in Portugal (one of the earliest colonizers of the Americas) for the sale of imported African slaves—the Mercado de Escravos, opened in 1444. In 1441, the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania.</p>
	<p> In 1519, Mexico's first Afro-Mexican slave was brought by Hernán Cortés.</p>
	<p> By 1552, black African slaves made up 10% of the population of Lisbon. In the second half of the 16th century, the Crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade and the focus of European trade in African slaves shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the Americas—in the case of Portugal, especially Brazil. In the 15th century one-third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange of gold.</p>
	<p> In order to establish itself as an American empire, Spain had to fight against the relatively powerful civilizations of the New World. The Spanish conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas included using the Natives as forced labour. The Spanish colonies were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola, see Atlantic slave trade.</p>

	<p> Bartolomé de Las Casas a 16th-century Dominican friar and Spanish historian participated in campaigns in Cuba (at Bayamo and Camagüey) and was present at the massacre of Hatuey; his observation of that massacre led him to fight for a social movement away from the use of natives as slaves and towards the importation of African Blacks as slaves. Also, the alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting the native population (Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513).</p>
	<p> The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501. In 1518, Charles I of Spain agreed to ship slaves directly from Africa. England played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade. The "slave triangle" was pioneered by Francis Drake and his associates. In 1640 a Virginia court sentenced John Punch to slavery, forcing him to serve his master, Hugh Gwyn, for the remainder of his life. This was the first legal sanctioning of slavery in the English colonies. In 1655, A black man, Anthony Johnson of Virginia, was granted ownership of John Casor as the result of a civil case.</p>
	<p> The Henrietta Marie was probably built in France sometime in the 17th century and carried a crew of about eighteen men. The ship came into English possession late in the 17th century, possibly as a war prize during the War of the Grand Alliance. It was put to use in the Atlantic slave trade, making at least two voyages carrying Africans to slavery in the West Indies. On its first voyage, in 1697–1698, the ship carried more than 200 people from Africa that were sold as slaves in Barbados. In 1699 the Henrietta Marie sailed from England on the first leg of the triangular trade route with a load of trade goods, including iron and copper bars, pewter utensils, glass beads, cloth and brandy. The ship sailed under license from the Royal African Company (which held a monopoly on English trade with Africa), in exchange for ten percent of the profits of the voyage. It is known to have traded for African captives at New Calabar on the Guinea Coast. The ship then sailed on the second leg of its voyage, from Africa to the West Indies, and in May 1701 landed 191 Africans for sale in Port Royal, Jamaica. The Henrietta Marie then loaded a cargo of sugar, cotton, dyewoods (indigo) and ginger to take back to England on the third leg of the triangular route. After leaving Port Royal on 18 May 1701, the ship headed for the Yucatán Channel to pass around the western end of Cuba (thus avoiding the pirates infesting the passage between Cuba and Hispaniola) and catch the Gulf Stream, the preferred route for all ships leaving the Caribbean to return to Europe. A month later, the Henrietta Marie wrecked on New Ground Reef near the Marquesas Keys, approximately 35 miles (56 kilometres) west of Key West. All aboard were lost.</p>

	<p> Pirates often targeted slavers. For example, the 300 ton English frigate Concord launched in 1710 but was captured by the French one year later. She was modified to hold more cargo, including slaves, and renamed La Concorde de Nantes. Sailing as a slave ship, she was captured by the pirate Captain Benjamin Hornigold on November 28, 1717, near the island of Martinique. Hornigold turned her over to one of his men, Edward Teach (later known as Blackbeard), and made him her captain. Teach then renamed her the Queen Anne's Revenge. By 1750, slavery was a legal institution in all of the 13 American colonies, and the profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
	<p> The trans-Atlantic slave trade peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by African kingdoms, such as the Oyo empire (Yoruba), the Ashanti Empire, the kingdom of Dahomey, and the Aro Confederacy. Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fierce African resistance. The slaves were brought to coastal outposts where they were traded for goods. A significant portion of African Americans in North America are descended from Mandinka people. Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the Fulani Jihad States, about half of the Senegambian Mandinka were converted to Islam while as many as a third were sold into slavery to the Americas through capture in conflict.</p>

	<p> An estimated 12 million Africans arrived in the Americas from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Of these, an estimated 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States. The usual estimate is that about 15% of slaves died during the voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships.</p>
	<p> Many Europeans who arrived in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries came under contract as indentured servants. The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640 where a negro, John Punch, was sentenced to lifetime slavery for attempting to run away. This case also marked the disparate treatment of Africans as held by the Virginia County Court, as two white runaways received far lesser sentences. After 1640, planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and kept their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the case Johnson v. Parker, where the court ruled that John Casor, an indentured servant, be returned to Johnson who claimed that Casor belonged to him for his life. According to the 1860 U. S. census, 393,975 individuals, representing 8% of all US families, owned 3,950,528 slaves. One-third of Southern families owned slaves.</p>

	<p> The largest number of slaves were shipped to Brazil. In the Spanish viceroyalty of New Granada, corresponding mainly to modern Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela, the free black population in 1789 was 420,000, whereas African slaves numbered only 20,000. Free blacks also outnumbered slaves in Brazil. By contrast, in Cuba, free blacks made up only 15% in 1827; and in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) it was a mere 5% in 1789.</p>
	<p> Author Charles Rappleye argued that:</p>
	<p> In the West Indies in particular, but also in North and South America, slavery was the engine that drove the mercantile empires of Europe. It appeared, in the eighteenth century, as universal and immutable as human nature.</p>

	<p> Although the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended shortly after the American Revolution, slavery remained a central economic institution in the Southern states of the United States, from where slavery expanded with the westward movement of population. Historian Peter Kolchin wrote, "By breaking up existing families and forcing slaves to relocate far from everyone and everything they knew" this migration "replicated (if on a reduced level) many of  horrors" of the Atlantic slave trade.</p>
	<p> Historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration the Second Middle Passage. Characterizing it as the "central event" in the life of a slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether they were uprooted themselves or simply lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, "the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free.."</p>
	<p> By 1860, 500,000 slaves had grown to 4 million. As long as slavery expanded, it remained profitable and powerful and was unlikely to disappear. Although complete statistics are lacking, it is estimated that 1,000,000 slaves moved west from the Old South between 1790 and 1860.</p>
	<p> Most of the slaves were moved from Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Michael Tadman, in a 1989 book Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South, indicates that 60–70% of interregional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820, a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance to be sold south by 1860.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Middle East</h2>
	<p> According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. There was also an extensive trade in Christian slaves in the Black Sea region for several centuries until the Crimean Khanate was destroyed by the Russian Empire in 1783. In the 1570s close to 20,000 slaves a year were being sold in the Crimean port of Kaffa. The slaves were captured in southern Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Circassia by Tatar horsemen. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.</p>
	<p> The Arab slave trade lasted more than a millennium. As recently as the early 1960s, Saudi Arabia's slave population was estimated at 300,000. Along with Yemen, the Saudis abolished slavery only in 1962. Historically, slaves in the Arab World came from many different regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Zanj), the Caucasus (mainly Circassians), Central Asia (mainly Tartars), and Central and Eastern Europe (mainly Saqaliba).</p>
	<p> Under Omani Arabs Zanzibar became East Africa's main slave port, with as many as 50,000 enslaved Africans passing through every year during the 19th century. Some historians estimate that between 11 and 18 million African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert from 650 to 1900 AD. Eduard Rüppell described the losses of Sudanese slaves being transported on foot to Egypt: "after the Daftardar bey's 1822 campaign in the southern Nuba mountains, nearly 40,000 slaves were captured. However, through bad treatment, disease and desert travel barely 5000 made it to Egypt.."</p>
	<p> The Moors, starting in the 8th century, also raided coastal areas around the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, and became known as the Barbary pirates. It is estimated that they captured 1.25 million white slaves from Western Europe and North America between the 16th and 19th centuries. The mortality rate was very high. For instance, plague killed a third to two-thirds of the 30,000 occupants of the slave pens in Algiers in 1662.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Abolitionism</h4>
	<p> Slavery has existed, in one form or another, through recorded human history—as have, in various periods, movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves.</p>
	<p> Ashoka, who ruled the Maurya Empire from 269–232 BCE, abolished the slave trade but not slavery. The Qin dynasty, which ruled China from 221 to 206 BC, abolished slavery and discouraged serfdom. However, many of its laws were overturned when the dynasty was overthrown. Slavery was again abolished, by Wang Mang, in China in 17 C.E but was reinstituted after his assassination.</p>
	<p> The Spanish colonization of the Americas sparked a discussion about the right to enslave Native Americans. A prominent critic of slavery in the Spanish New World colonies was Bartolomé de las Casas, who opposed the enslavement of Native Americans, and later also of Africans in America.</p>
	<p> One of the first protests against slavery came from German and Dutch Quakers in Pennsylvania in 1688. One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in England in 1772, with British judge Lord Mansfield, whose opinion in Somersett's Case was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England. This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in England. In 1777, Vermont, at the time an independent nation, became the first portion of what would become the United States to abolish slavery. France abolished slavery in 1794.</p>
	<p> Joseph Jenkins Roberts, born in Virginia, was the first president of Liberia, which was founded in 1822 for freed American slaves.</p>
	<p> British Member of Parliament William Wilberforce led the anti-slavery movement in the United Kingdom, although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by Thomas Clarkson. Wilberforce was also urged by his close friend, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, to make the issue his own, and was also given support by reformed Evangelical John Newton. The Slave Trade Act was passed by the British Parliament on March 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire, Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which he lived to see in the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. After the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to encouraging other countries to follow suit, notably France and the British colonies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.</p>
	<p> In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, Anti-Slavery International, was formed in Britain by Joseph Sturge, which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries. There were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British Anti-Slavery Society.</p>
	<p> In the United States, abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation. After January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited, but not the internal slave trade, nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted; and those slaves already in the U.S. were legally emancipated only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the Underground Railroad. Violent clashes between anti-slavery and pro-slavery Americans included Bleeding Kansas, a series of political and armed disputes in 1854–1861 as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a slave or free state. By 1860, the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the American Civil War, beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the 13th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country.</p>
	<p> Photographed in 1863 – Gordon aka Peter, a man who was enslaved in Louisiana. This famous photo was distributed by abolitionists as evidence of the cruelty of slavery.</p>
	<p> In the case of freed slaves of the United States, many became sharecroppers and indentured servants. In this manner, some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity due to Jim Crow laws which perpetuated discrimination, limited education, promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty. Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred upward mobility further.</p>
	<p> In the 1860s, David Livingstone's reports of atrocities within the Arab slave trade in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress "this abominable Eastern trade", at Zanzibar in particular. In 1905, the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of French West Africa.</p>
	<p> On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized human right. Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</p>
	<p> No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.</p>
	<p> In 2014, for the first time in history, major leaders of many religions, Buddhist, Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020. The signatories were: Pope Francis, Mātā Amṛtānandamayī, Bhikkhuni Thich Nu Chân Không (representing Zen Master Thích Nhất Hạnh), Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana, Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Rabbi David Rosen, Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman, Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, Sheikh Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar, Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Basheer Hussain al Najafi), Sheikh Omar Abboud, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.)</p>
	<p> Groups such as the American Anti-Slavery Group, Anti-Slavery International, Free the Slaves, the Anti-Slavery Society, and the Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society continue to campaign to eliminate slavery.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Characteristics</h4>
	<h3> Economics</h3>
	<p> Economists have attempted to model the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as serfdom) appear and disappear. One observation is that slavery becomes more desirable for landowners where land is abundant but labour is scarce, such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages. If the opposite holds true, then it becomes more costly for landowners to have guards for the slaves than to employ paid workers who can only demand low wages due to the amount of competition. Thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew, but were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of new land with few people became available. In his books, Time on the Cross and Without Consent or Contract: the Rise and Fall of American Slavery, Robert Fogel maintains that slavery was in fact a profitable method of production, especially on bigger plantations growing cotton that fetched high prices in the world market. It gave whites in the South higher average incomes than those in the North, but most of the money was spent on buying slaves and plantations.</p>
	<p> Slavery is more common when the labour done is relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It is much more difficult and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made his or her performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.</p>
	<p> Critics since the 18th century have argued that slavery tends to retard technological advancement, since the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading the efficiency of labour. Because of this, theoretical knowledge and learning in Greece—and later in Rome—was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing.</p>
	<p> Adam Smith made the argument that free labour was economically better than slave labour, and argued further that slavery in Europe ended during the Middle Ages, and then only after both the church and state were separate, independent and strong institutions, that it is nearly impossible to end slavery in a free, democratic and republican forms of governments since many of its legislators or political figures were slave owners, and would not punish themselves, and that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom when there was centralized government, or a central authority like a king or the church. Similar arguments appear later in the works of Auguste Comte, especially when it comes to Adam Smith's belief in the separation of powers or what Comte called the "separation of the spiritual and the temporal" during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery, and Smith's criticism of masters, past and present. As Smith stated in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, "The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty. But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great. Where ever any one of these was wanting, slavery still continues.."</p>
	<p> Slaves can be an attractive investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for sustenance and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free labourers, because free workers earn more than sustenance, in these cases slaves have positive price. When the cost of sustenance and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning would no longer be profitable, and owners would simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage environments, and environments where enforcement is cheap, and less attractive in environments where the wage-rate is low and enforcement is expensive.</p>
	<p> Free workers also earn compensating differentials, whereby they are paid more for doing unpleasant work. Neither sustenance nor enforcement costs rise with the unpleasantness of the work, however, so slaves' costs do not rise by the same amount. As such, slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. Because the unpleasantness of the work is not internalised, being born by the slave rather than the owner, it is a negative externality and leads to over-use of slaves in these situations.</p>
	<p> The weighted average global sales price of a slave is calculated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa. Worldwide slavery is a criminal offense but slave owners can get very high returns for their risk. According to researcher Siddharth Kara, the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal enterprises. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. Approximately 40% of slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves.</p>
	<p> Robert E. Wright has developed a model that helps to predict when firms (individuals, companies) will be more likely to use slaves rather than wage workers, indentured servants, family members, or other types of labourers.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Identification</h3>
	<p> Throughout history, slaves were clothed in a distinctive fashion, particularly with respect to footwear or rather the lack thereof. This was both due to economic reasons as well as a distinguishing feature, especially in South Africa and South America. For example, the Cape Town slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes." This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot. To quote Brother Riemer (1779): " are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted."</p>
	<p> As shoes have been considered badges of freedom since biblical times "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put  on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on  feet (Luke 15:22)" this aspect has been an informal law wherever slavery existed. A barefoot person could therefore be clearly identified as a slave upon first sight. In certain societies this rule is valid to this day, as with the Tuareg slavery which is still unofficially practiced, and their slaves have to go barefoot.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Apologies</h4>
	<p> On May 21, 2001, the National Assembly of France passed the Taubira law, recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals. Indeed, as already mentioned in this article, slavery persists in several areas of West Africa until the present day.</p>
	<p> There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade. Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans.</p>
	<p> Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the Atlantic slave trade. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.</p>
	<p> In 1999, President Mathieu Kerekou of Benin (formerly the Kingdom of Dahomey) issued a national apology for the central role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade. Luc Gnacadja, minister of environment and housing for Benin, later said: "The slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it." Researchers estimate that 3 million slaves were exported out of the Slave Coast bordering the Bight of Benin. President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana also apologized for his country's involvement in the slave trade.</p>
	<p> The issue of an apology is linked to reparations for slavery and is still being pursued by a number of entities across the world. For example, the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action Plan.</p>
	<p> In September 2006, it was reported that the UK government might issue a "statement of regret" over slavery. This was followed by a "public statement of sorrow" from Tony Blair on November 27, 2006, and a formal apology on March 14, 2007.</p>
	<p> On February 25, 2007, the Commonwealth of Virginia resolved to 'profoundly regret' and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. Unique and the first of its kind in the U. S., the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, where the first slaves were imported into North America in 1619.</p>
	<p> Liverpool, which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999. On August 24, 2007, Mayor Ken Livingstone of London, United Kingdom, apologized publicly for Britain's role in colonial slave trade. "You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery," he said, pointing towards the financial district. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Specifically, London outfitted, financed, and insured many of the ships, which helped fund the building of London's docks. Jesse Jackson praised Livingstone, and added that reparations should be made, one of his common arguments.</p>
	<p> On July 30, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws. In June 2009, the US Senate passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for the "fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery". The news was welcomed by President Barack Obama, the nation's first President of African descent. Some of President Obama's ancestors were slave owners.</p>
	<p> In 2010, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi apologized for Arab involvement in the slave trade, saying: "I regret the behavior of the Arabs… They brought African children to North Africa, they made them slaves, they sold them like animals, and they took them as slaves and traded them in a shameful way."</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Reparations</h3>
	<p> There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves, or sometimes their descendants. Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a civil law matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relative lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile legal process. Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this "civil court problem.."Since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. In nearly all cases the judicial system has ruled that the statute of limitations on these possible claims has long since expired.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Other uses of the term</h4>
	<p> The word slavery is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing.</p>
	<p> Proponents of animal rights apply the term slavery to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.</p>
	<p> Some argue that military drafts and other forms of coerced government labour constitute state-operated slavery. Some libertarians and anarcho-capitalists view government taxation as a form of slavery.</p>
	<p> Some Antipsychiatry proponents apply the term slavery to the involuntary psychiatric patient. There are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness, and the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of his/her psychiatrist. Drapetomania was a psychiatric diagnosis for a slave who did not want to be a slave. Thomas Szasz wrote a book titled "Psychiatric Slavery", published in 1998 and a book titled " Liberation by Oppression: A Comparative Study of Slavery and Psychiatry", published in 2003.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Wage slavery</h3>
	<p> Some socialists, view total and immediate wage dependence as a form of slavery. The labour market, as institutionalised under today's market economic systems, has been criticised, especially by both mainstream socialists and anarcho-syndicalists, who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative for wage labour. Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery. Cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.</p>
	<p> For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labour, provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism. "It can be persuasively argued," noted one concerned philosopher, "that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it."</p>
	<br>
	<h4> In film</h4>
	<p> Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world. The American film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as Birth of a Nation (1915) and Gone with the Wind (1939) became controversial because they gave a favourable depiction. The last favourable treatment was Song of the South from Disney in 1946. In 1940 The Santa Fe Trail gave a liberal but ambiguous interpretation of John Brown's attacks on slavery—the film does not know what to do with slavery. The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s made defiant slaves into heroes. The question of slavery in American memory necessarily involves its depictions in feature films.</p>
	<p> Most Hollywood films used American settings, although Spartacus (1960), dealt with an actual revolt in the Roman Empire known as the Third Servile War. It failed and all the rebels were executed, but their spirit lived on according to the film. The Last Supper (La última cena in Spanish) was a 1976 film directed by Cuban Tomás Gutiérrez Alea about the teaching of Christianity to slaves in Cuba, and emphasizes the role of ritual and revolt. Burn! takes place on the imaginary Portuguese island of Queimada (where the locals speak Spanish) and it merges historical events that took place in Brazil, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Jamaica, and elsewhere. Spartacus stays surprisingly close to the historical record.</p>
	<p> Historians agree that films have largely shaped historical memories, but they debate issues of accuracy, plausibility, moralism, sensationalism, how facts are stretched in search of broader truths, and suitability for the classroom. Berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality, or if it glosses over the harshness to highlight the emotional impact of slavery.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Spain, large European kingdom, bounded by Portugal, the sea and the Pyrenees. It is about 240 leagues long and 200 leagues wide. Long. 9° 21', Lat. 36° 44'.</p>
	<p> I will leave the other details to geographers and here retrace the portrait that a great artist has made of the upheavals in this kingdom in his Histoire du siècle de Louis XIV.</p>
	<p> Spain, subjected in turn by the Carthaginians, the Romans, the Goths, the Vandals and the Arabs known as Moors , finally fell under the domination of Ferdinand, who was rightly called the King of Spain, since he united all parts of the country under his rule: Aragon by himself, Castile by Isabelle, his wife, the kingdom of Grenada by his defeat of the Moors and the kingdom of Navarre by usurpation. He died in 1516.</p>
	<p> His successor, Charles V, conceived the project of a universal Christian monarchy and only abandoned the idea through the exhaustion of his strength and his resignation from the empire in 1556.</p>
	<p> The vast project of the universal monarchy, begun by Charles V, was supported by his son, Phillip II. His aim, from the depths of the Escorial palace, was to subjugate the rest of Christendom by negotiation and arms; he invaded Portugal, ravaged France and threatened England. But being fitter to trade slaves far away than to fight his enemies near at hand, he could add no other conquests to the easy invasion of Portugal. By his own admission he sacrificed fifteen hundred million ducats, which would today in our money be three thousand million, in order to subject France and win back the seven United Provinces, but his treasures only succeeded in enriching the countries he tried to dominate. He died in 1598.</p>
	<p> Under Phillip III, the greatness of Spainbecame merely a vast body without substance, with more reputation than strength. This king, less warlike and even less wise than Phillip II, had few kingly virtues. He corrupted the kingdom and weakened the monarchy by superstition, the vice of weak minds, by the many colonies he established in the New World, and by exiling nearly eight hundred thousand Moors, when he should on the contrary have added the same number of subjects to the population. His life ended in 1621.</p>
	<p> Phillip IV inherited the weakness of his father, lost Portugal by his negligence, Roussillon by the feebleness of his arms and Catalonia by the abuses of despotism. He died in 1665.</p>
	<p> Finally, the Inquisition, the monks and the lazy pride of its inhabitants let the riches of the New World pass into others’ hands. This great kingdom, which once inspired terror across Europe, has gradually fallen into a state of decline from which it will be hard to recover.</p>
	<p> With little power abroad, poor and weak at home, Spainhas no industry to add to the gifts brought to its happy climes by the navy. The silks of Valencia, the fine wools of Andalusia and Castile, the piastres and the merchandise of the New World benefit Spainless than other trading nations, which have entrusted their wealth to the Spanish, and have never regretted it. This special trustworthiness that the Spanish once had for keeping goods, and which was praised by Justin, they still have today, but this admirable quality, when combined with their laziness, produces results that are detrimental to them. Under their very eyes, other nations carry on the monarchy’s trade. It is quite probably a good thing for Europe that Mexico, Peru and Chile are ruled by an indolent nation.</p>
	<p> It would no doubt be a striking event if the Americas were to overthrow the yoke of Spain, and if a skilful viceroy of the Indies, joining up with the party of the Americans, were to support them with his power and his talent. They would soon grow our European produce on their lands and, since the inhabitants would have no more use for our goods or our foodstuffs, we would fall into more or less the same state of abject poverty in which we languished four centuries ago. Spain, I admit, seems for the time being sheltered from such a revolution, but the empire of fortune and chance is wide, and can men’s prudence claim to predict and master everything the future might bring?</p>`,

	eArt: `<p> Suicide is an act by which a man is himself the cause of his death. Since this may happen in two ways, one direct and the other indirect, in morals one also distinguishes direct suicide from indirect suicide .</p>
	<p> By suicide one usually means the act of a man who deliberately deprives himself of life in a violent manner. As for the morality of this act, it must be said that it is absolutely contrary to the law of nature. This is proved in various ways. We will give only the main reasons here.</p>
	<p> 1. It is certain that the instinct that we feel for our preservation, and which is natural to all men and even to all creatures, comes from the creator. One can therefore regard it as a natural law engraved in the heart of man by the creator. It [the heart] contains within itself his commands in regard to our existence. Thus all who act contrary to this instinct that is so natural to them act contrary to the will of their creator.</p>
	<p> 2. Man is not the master of his life. Since he did not give it to himself, he cannot regard it as a possession that he may dispose of as he pleases. He owes his life to his creator; it is a kind of deposit that he has entrusted to him. It is for him alone to withdraw his deposit when he finds it appropriate. Thus man does not have the right to do what he wants with it or, even less, to destroy it altogether.</p>
	<p> 3. The objective that the creator has in creating a man is surely that he continue to exist and also to live as long as God pleases, and since this purpose alone is not worthy of such a perfect God, it must be added that he wishes man to live for the glory of the creator and in order to display his perfections. But this intention is foiled by suicide . In destroying himself, man removes from the world a piece of work that was destined for the manifestation of divine perfections.</p>
	<p> 4. We are not in the world only for ourselves. We are in close connection with other men, with our country, with our relatives, with our family. Everyone requires of us certain duties from which we may not exempt ourselves on our own. It is therefore violating the duties of society to abandon it ahead of time and at the moment when we could render it the services that we owe it. It cannot be said that a man could find himself in a situation in which he was assured that he is of no use to society. This situation is not at all possible. In the most hopeless sickness, a man may always be useful to others, if it is only through the example of courage, patience, etc. that he gives them.</p>
	<p> Finally, the first obligation that man is under in relation to himself is to preserve himself in a state of happiness and to improve himself more and more. This duty is consistent with the desire that everyone has to make himself happy. In depriving himself of life, he therefore ignores what he owes to himself. He interrupts the course of his happiness. He deprives himself of the means of improving himself further in this world. It is true that those who kill themselves regard death as a state happier than life, but in this they reason badly. They can never have complete certainty. They can never prove that their life is a greater misfortune than death. And there is the key for replying to various questions that are formulated according to the different situations in which a man may find himself.</p>
	<p> It is asked, first, if a soldier may kill himself so as not to fall into the hands of enemies, as often happened in past centuries. To this question may be added another one that comes to the same thing and to which one must give the same answer, that is, if a ship captain may set fire to his vessel in order to blow it up so that the enemy does not make himself master of it. Several among the moralists believe that suicide is allowed in these two situations because love of country is the motive for these acts. It is a way of hindering the enemy for which one must assume the consent of the sovereign, who wants to harm his enemy in whatever way it might be. These reasons, although specious, are however not without exceptions. In the first place, it is certain that, in a situation of this importance, it is not enough to take the consent of the sovereign for granted. As long as the sovereign has not made his will known explicitly, it is necessary to consider the case uncertain, but, in an uncertain case, one should not choose the most violent course, which violates so many other duties that are obvious and unchallenged.</p>
	<p> This question has given rise to a second, that is, if it is necessary to obey a ruler who orders you to kill yourself. Here is what one usually answers. If the man who receives this order is a criminal who deserves death, he should obey without fear of committing punishable suicide because in this he only does what the executioner should do. With the death sentence pronounced, it is not he who takes his life; it is the judge whom he obeys as an instrument who takes it from him. But if this man is innocent, it is better that he refuse to execute this order because no sovereign has authority over the life of an innocent man. In addition, this third question is posed, that is, if an unfortunate man condemned to a shameful and painful death may avoid it by killing himself. All moralists are for the negative here. Such a man infringes on the authority that the magistrate has over him to punish him. At the same time, he thwarts the intention of inspiring, through punishment, horror of crimes comparable to his.</p>
	<p> Let us say a word about indirect suicide . By this is meant any act that causes premature death without one's having specifically had the intention of bringing it about oneself. This happens in yielding to outbursts of violent passions or in leading a dissolute life or in denying oneself necessities out of disgraceful avarice or in exposing oneself imprudently to an obvious danger. The same reasons that prohibit making a direct attempt on one's life also condemn indirect suicide, as it is easy to see.</p>
	<p> As for the imputation of suicide, it must be observed that it depends on the mental state a man is in before and at the moment when he kills himself. If a man who has a disturbed mind or who has fallen into a dismal melancholy or who is in a frenzy, if such a man kills himself, his act cannot be regarded as a crime because, in such a state, he does not know what he is doing. But if he does it deliberately, the act is wholly imputed to him. Although it is objected that no man in possession of his reason can kill himself and that all self-murderers can, in effect, be regarded as madmen at the moment when they take their lives, one must, however, take their previous lives into consideration. It is there that the origin of their despair is usually found. Perhaps they do not know what they are doing at the moment when they kill themselves, with their minds so disturbed by their passions, but it is their fault. If they had attempted to master their passions from the beginning, they surely would have avoided the woes of their present states. The last act thus being a consequence of preceding acts, it is imputed to them along with the others.</p>
	<p> Suicide was always a subject of disagreement among the ancient philosophers. The Stoics allowed their sage to commit it. The Platonists maintained that life is a station in which God placed man and, consequently, that he is not allowed to abandon it on a whim. Among the moderns, the abbé de Saint-Cyran maintained that there are some situations in which one may kill oneself. Here is the title of his book: Question royale où il est montré en quelle extrémité, principalement en tems de paix, le sujet pourroit être obligé de conserver la vie du prince aux dépens de la sienne.</p>
	<p> Although it is not at all uncertain that the Christian church condemns suicide, there have been Christians who wished to justify it. Among this number is doctor Donne, a learned English theologian, who, undoubtedly to comfort his compatriots, whom melancholy often leads to cause their own deaths, undertakes to prove that suicide is not prohibited in Holy Scripture and was not regarded as a crime during the first centuries of the Church.</p>
	<p> His work, written in English, is entitled Biathanatos: A declaration of that paradox or thesis that self-homicide is not so naturally sin and that it may never be otherwise, etc., London 1700, which means exposition d'un paradoxe ou système qui prouve que le suicide n'est pas toujours un péché naturel, Londres 1700. This doctor Donne died as the dean of St. Paul's, an office that he attained after the publication of his work.</p>
	<p> In his book he claims to prove that suicide is not against the law of nature, reason, or the revealed law of God. He shows that in the Old Testament, men acceptable to God caused their own deaths themselves, which he proves by the example of Samson, who died crushed under the ruins of a temple that he made fall on the Philistines and himself. He also relies on the example of Eleazar, who caused himself to be crushed under an elephant while fighting for his country, an act that is praised by St. Ambrose. Everyone knows, among the pagans, the examples of Codrus, Curtius, Decius, Lucretius, Cato, etc.</p>
	<p> In the New Testament, he wants to strengthen his system by the example of Jesus Christ, whose death was voluntary. He regards a great number of martyrs as genuine suicides, as well as a host of hermits and penitents who caused their deaths little by little. St. Clement exhorts the first Christians to seek martyrdom in pointing out to them the example of pagans who gave themselves up for their country. (The Stromata, book IV .) Tertullian condemned those who fled from persecution. See Tertullian, De fuga, proposition II. In the time of persecution, each Christian confronted death bravely in order to reach heaven, and, when a martyr was executed, those present shouted, I am a Christian, too . Eusebius reports that a martyr named Germanus provoked the beasts in order to depart from life more quickly. St. Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, in his letter to the faithful in Rome, entreats them not to ask his blessing [for this rationale]: voluntarius morior quia mihi utile est mori [I die voluntarily because it is useful for me to die].</p>
	<p> Bodin, following Tertullian, reports that, during a persecution that arose against the Christians of Africa, the fervor for martyrdom was so great that the proconsul, tired of executions himself, had the public crier ask if there were still Christians who wished to die . And since a collective voice was heard that answered yes, the proconsul told them to go hang and drown themselves on their own in order to spare the judges the trouble of it. See Bodin, Demonst, book IV, chapter iii. This proves that, in the early Church, Christians were hungry for martyrdom and offered themselves voluntarily for death. This zeal was subsequently checked by the council of Laodicea, canon 33, and by the council of Carthage, canon 2, in which the Church distinguished true from false martyrs and it was prohibited to risk death voluntarily.</p>
	<p> Ecclesiastical history, however, gives us examples of male and female saints honored by the Church who risked certain death. It is thus that St. Pelagia and her mother hurled themselves out a window and drowned themselves. See St. Augustine, De civitate dei, book I, chapter xxvi . [5] St. Apollonia hastened to throw herself in the fire. Baronius says of the first that he can only say of this act, quid ad hoec dicamus non habemus [We have nothing to say about this matter]. On this subject St. Ambrose also says that God cannot take offense at our death when we choose it as a remedy. See Ambrose, De virginitate, book III.</p>
	<p> The English theologian further strengthens his system by the example of our missionaries, who willingly risk certain death in going to preach the Gospel to peoples whom they know to be not much disposed to receive it, which does not prevent the Church from placing them in the ranks of the saints and proposing them as objects worthy of the veneration of the faithful. Such are St. Francis Xavier and many others whom the Church has canonized.</p>
	<p> Doctor Donne further strengthens his argument with an apostolic constitution, mentioned in book IV, chapter vii and chapter ix, which states formally that a man should consent to die of hunger rather than receive nourishment from the hand of an excommunicate. Athenagoras says that several Christians of his time disfigured themselves and made themselves eunuchs. St. Jerome tells us that St. Mark the evangelist cut his thumb off so as not to be made a priest. See Prolegomena in Marcum.</p>
	<p> The same author, finally, places among the numbers of suicides the penitents who, by dint of austerities, macerations, and voluntary torments, damaged their health and hastened their deaths. He claims that one cannot put suicides on trial without doing the same to monks and nuns who voluntarily submit to a rule austere enough to shorten their lives. He quotes the rule of the Carthusians, which prohibits them from eating meat, even if this could save their lives. It is thus that Mr. Donne establishes his system, which will certainly not be approved by orthodox theologians.</p>
	<p> In 1732, London witnessed an example of a memorable suicide, reported by Mr. Smollett in his history of England. One Richard Smith and his wife, put in prison for debt, both hanged themselves after having killed their child. In their room were found two letters written to a friend to ask him to take care of their dog and cat. They took care to leave something to pay the carrier of these notes, in which they explained the motives for their conduct, adding that they did not believe that God could take pleasure in seeing his creatures unhappy and without resources and that, moreover, they resigned themselves to what it pleased him to command about them in the next life, entrusting themselves entirely to his goodness. A very strange mixture of religion and crime!</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death.[6] Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, substance misuse, and use of benzodiazepines.[7][4][2] Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying.[2][8] Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts.[2] Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions.[2] Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness.[9]</p>
	<p> The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means.[10] Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.[2][3] Suicide resulted in 828,000 deaths globally in 2015 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990).[5][11] This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.[4][12]</p>
	<p> Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year.[12][13] Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world.[2] Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world.[1] Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk.[1] There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year.[14] Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females.[13]</p>
	<p> Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life.[15][16] The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.[17] During the samurai era in Japan, a form of suicide known as seppuku (harakiri) was respected as a means of making up for failure or as a form of protest.[18] Sati, a practice outlawed by the British Raj, expected the Indian widow to kill herself on her husband's funeral fire, either willingly or under pressure from the family and society.[19] Suicide and attempted suicide, while previously illegal, are no longer so in most Western countries.[20] It remains a criminal offense in many countries.[21] In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide has been used on rare occasions as a form of protest, and kamikaze and suicide bombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic.[22] The word is from the Latin suicidium, which means "the killing of oneself".[23]</p>
	<p> Definitions</p>
	<p> Suicide, also known as completed suicide, is the "act of taking one's own life".[6] Attempted suicide or non-fatal suicidal behavior is self-injury with the desire to end one's life that does not result in death.[24] Assisted suicide is when one individual helps another bring about their own death indirectly via providing either advice or the means to the end.[25] This is in contrast to euthanasia, where another person takes a more active role in bringing about a person's death.[25] Suicidal ideation is thoughts of ending one's life but not taking any active efforts to do so.[24]</p>
	<p> There is discussion about the appropriateness of the term "commit", and its use to describe suicide. Those who object to the use of commit argue that it carries with it implications that suicide is a criminal, sinful or morally wrong act.[26] There is growing consensus that it is more appropriate to use "completed suicide", "died by suicide" or simply "killed him/herself" to describe the act of suicide, and this is reflected in mental health organisations' media guidance.[27][28][29][30] Despite these efforts, "committed suicide" and similar descriptions remain common in both scholarly research and journalism.[31][32]</p>
	<p> Risk factors</p>
	<p> The precipitating circumstances for suicide from 16 American states in 2008[33]</p>
	<p> Factors that affect the risk of suicide include mental disorders, drug misuse, psychological states, cultural, family and social situations, and genetics.[34] Mental disorders and substance misuse frequently co-exist.[35] Other risk factors include having previously attempted suicide,[13] the ready availability of a means to take one's life, a family history of suicide, or the presence of traumatic brain injury.[36] For example, suicide rates have been found to be greater in households with firearms than those without them.[37]</p>
	<p> Socio-economic problems such as unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and discrimination may trigger suicidal thoughts.[38][39] About 15–40% of people leave a suicide note.[40] War veterans have a higher risk of suicide due in part to higher rates of mental illness such as post traumatic stress disorder and physical health problems related to war.[41] Genetics appears to account for between 38% and 55% of suicidal behaviors.[42]</p>
	<p> Mental disorders</p>
	<p> Mental disorders are often present at the time of suicide with estimates ranging from 27%[43] to more than 90%.[13] In Asia, rates of mental disorders appear to be lower than in Western countries.[1] Of those who have been admitted to a psychiatric unit, their lifetime risk of completed suicide is about 8.6%.[13] Half of all people who die by suicide may have major depressive disorder; having this or one of the other mood disorders such as bipolar disorder increases the risk of suicide 20-fold.[44] Other conditions implicated include schizophrenia (14%), personality disorders (8%),[45][46] bipolar disorder,[44] obsessive compulsive disorder,[47] and posttraumatic stress disorder.[13]</p>
	<p> Others estimate that about half of people who complete suicide could be diagnosed with a personality disorder with borderline personality disorder being the most common.[48] About 5% of people with schizophrenia die of suicide.[49] Eating disorders are another high risk condition.[50]</p>
	<p> In approximately 80% of completed suicides, the individual has seen a physician within the year before their death,[51] including 45% within the prior month.[52] Approximately 25–40% of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year.[43][51] Antidepressants of the SSRI type appear to increase the risk of suicide in children but do not change the risk in adults.[53]</p>
	<p> Previous attempts and self-harm</p>
	<p> A previous history of suicide attempts is the most accurate predictor of completed suicide.[13] Approximately 20% of suicides have had a previous attempt, and of those who have attempted suicide, 1% complete suicide within a year[13] and more than 5% die by suicide within 10 years.[50] Acts of self-harm are not usually suicide attempts and most who self-harm are not at high risk of suicide.[54] Some who self-harm, however, do still end their life by suicide, and risk for self-harm and suicide may overlap.[54]</p>
	<p> Substance use</p>
	<p> "The Drunkard's Progress", 1846 demonstrating how alcoholism can lead to poverty, crime, and eventually suicide</p>
	<p> Substance abuse is the second most common risk factor for suicide after major depression and bipolar disorder.[55] Both chronic substance misuse as well as acute intoxication are associated.[35][56] When combined with personal grief, such as bereavement, the risk is further increased.[56] Substance misuse is also associated with mental health disorders.[35]</p>
	<p> Most people are under the influence of sedative-hypnotic drugs (such as alcohol or benzodiazepines) when they die by suicide[57] with alcoholism present in between 15% and 61% of cases.[35] Use of prescribed benzodiazepines is asscociated with an increased rate of attempted and completed suicide. The prosuicidal effects of benzodiazepines are suspected to be due to a psychiatric disturbance caused by side effects or withdrawal symptoms.[7] Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide.[58] About 2.2–3.4% of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide.[58] Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male, older, and have tried to take their own lives in the past.[35] Between 3 and 35% of deaths among those who use heroin are due to suicide (approximately 14 fold greater than those who do not use).[59] In adolescents who misuse alcohol, neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide.[60]</p>
	<p> The misuse of cocaine and methamphetamine has a high correlation with suicide.[35][61] In those who use cocaine the risk is greatest during the withdrawal phase.[62] Those who used inhalants are also at significant risk with around 20% attempting suicide at some point and more than 65% considering it.[35] Smoking cigarettes is associated with the risk of suicide.[63] There is little evidence as to why this association exists; however it has been hypothesized that those who are predisposed to smoking are also predisposed to suicide, that smoking causes health problems which subsequently make people want to end their life, and that smoking affects brain chemistry causing a propensity for suicide.[63] Cannabis however does not appear to independently increase the risk.[35]</p>
	<p> Problem gambling</p>
	<p> Problem gambling is associated with increased suicidal ideation and attempts compared to the general population.[64] Between 12 and 24% pathological gamblers attempt suicide.[65] The rate of suicide among their spouses is three times greater than that of the general population.[65] Other factors that increase the risk in problem gamblers include mental illness, alcohol and drug misuse.[66]</p>
	<p> Medical conditions</p>
	<p> There is an association between suicidality and physical health problems such as[50] chronic pain,[67] traumatic brain injury,[68] cancer,[69] kidney failure (requiring hemodialysis), HIV, and systemic lupus erythematosus.[50] The diagnosis of cancer approximately doubles the subsequent risk of suicide.[69] The prevalence of increased suicidality persisted after adjusting for depressive illness and alcohol abuse. In people with more than one medical condition the risk was particularly high. In Japan, health problems are listed as the primary justification for suicide.[70]</p>
	<p> Sleep disturbances such as insomnia[71] and sleep apnea are risk factors for depression and suicide. In some instances the sleep disturbances may be a risk factor independent of depression.[72] A number of other medical conditions may present with symptoms similar to mood disorders, including hypothyroidism, Alzheimer's, brain tumors, systemic lupus erythematosus, and adverse effects from a number of medications (such as beta blockers and steroids).[13]</p>
	<p> Psychosocial states</p>
	<p> A number of psychological states increase the risk of suicide including: hopelessness, loss of pleasure in life, depression and anxiousness.[44] A poor ability to solve problems, the loss of abilities one used to have, and poor impulse control also play a role.[44][73] In older adults the perception of being a burden to others is important.[74] Suicide in which the reason is that the person feels that they are not part of society is known as egoistic suicide.[75] Rates of suicide appear to decrease around Christmas.[76] One study however found the risk may be greater for males on their birthday.[77]</p>
	<p> Recent life stresses such as a loss of a family member or friend, loss of a job, or social isolation (such as living alone) increase the risk.[44] Those who have never married are also at greater risk.[13] Being religious may reduce one's risk of suicide.[78] This has been attributed to the negative stance many religions take against suicide and to the greater connectedness religion may give.[78] Muslims, among religious people, appear to have a lower rate of suicide; however the data supporting this is not strong.[21] There does not appear to be a difference in rates of attempted suicide rates.[21] Young women in the Middle East may have higher rates.[79]</p>
	<p> Some may take their own lives to escape bullying or prejudice.[80] A history of childhood sexual abuse[81] and time spent in foster care are also risk factors.[82] Sexual abuse is believed to contribute to about 20% of the overall risk.[42]</p>
	<p> An evolutionary explanation for suicide is that it may improve inclusive fitness. This may occur if the person dying by suicide cannot have more children and takes resources away from relatives by staying alive. An objection is that deaths by healthy adolescents likely does not increase inclusive fitness. Adaptation to a very different ancestral environment may be maladaptive in the current one.[73][83]</p>
	<p> Poverty is associated with the risk of suicide.[84] Increasing relative poverty compared to those around a person increases suicide risk.[85] Over 200,000 farmers in India have died by suicide since 1997, partly due to issues of debt.[86] In China suicide is three times as likely in rural regions as urban ones, partly, it is believed, due to financial difficulties in this area of the country.[87]</p>
	<p> Media</p>
	<p> In Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, the title character kills himself due to a love triangle involving Charlotte (pictured at his grave). Some admirers of the story were triggered into copycat suicide, known as the Werther effect.</p>
	<p> The media, which includes the Internet, plays an important role.[34] How it depicts suicide may have a negative effect, with high-volume, prominent, repetitive coverage glorifying or romanticizing suicide having the most impact.[88] When detailed descriptions of how to kill oneself by a specific means are portrayed, this method of suicide may increase in the population as a whole.[10]</p>
	<p> This trigger of suicide contagion or copycat suicide is known as the Werther effect, named after the protagonist in Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther who killed himself and then was emulated by many admirers of the book.[89] This risk is greater in adolescents who may romanticize death.[90] It appears that while news media has a significant effect; that of the entertainment media is equivocal.[91][92] The opposite of the Werther effect is the proposed Papageno effect, in which coverage of effective coping mechanisms may have a protective effect. The term is based upon a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, who (fearing the loss of a loved one) had planned to kill himself until his friends helped him out.[89] When media follows recommended reporting guidelines the risk of suicides can be decreased.[88] Getting buy-in from industry, however, can be difficult, especially in the long term.[88]</p>
	<p> Rational</p>
	<p> Rational suicide is the reasoned taking of one's own life,[93] although others consider suicide as never rational.[93] The act of taking one's life for the benefit of others is known as altruistic suicide.[94] An example of this is an elder ending his or her life to leave greater amounts of food for the younger people in the community.[94] Suicide in some Inuit cultures has been seen as an act of respect, courage, or wisdom.[95]</p>
	<p> A suicide attack is a political action where an attacker carries out violence against others which they understand will result in their own death.[96] Some suicide bombers are motivated by a desire to obtain martyrdoms.[41] Kamikaze missions were carried out as a duty to a higher cause or moral obligation.[95] Murder–suicide is an act of homicide followed within a week by suicide of the person who carried out the act.[97]</p>
	<p> Mass suicides are often performed under social pressure where members give up autonomy to a leader.[98] Mass suicides can take place with as few as two people, often referred to as a suicide pact.[99]</p>
	<p> In extenuating situations where continuing to live would be intolerable, some people use suicide as a means of escape.[100] Some inmates in Nazi concentration camps are known to have killed themselves by deliberately touching the electrified fences.[101]</p>
	<p> Methods</p>
	<p> Case fatality rate by suicide method in the United States[37]</p>
	<p> Main article: Suicide methods</p>
	<p> The leading method of suicide varies among countries. The leading methods in different regions include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.[3] These differences are believed to be in part due to availability of the different methods.[10] A review of 56 countries found that hanging was the most common method in most of the countries,[102] accounting for 53% of the male suicides and 39% of the female suicides.[103]</p>
	<p> Worldwide, 30% of suicides are estimated to occur from pesticide poisoning, most of which occur in the developing world.[2] The use of this method varies markedly from 4% in Europe to more than 50% in the Pacific region.[104] It is also common in Latin America due to easy access within the farming populations.[10] In many countries, drug overdoses account for approximately 60% of suicides among women and 30% among men.[105] Many are unplanned and occur during an acute period of ambivalence.[10] The death rate varies by method: firearms 80–90%, drowning 65–80%, hanging 60–85%, car exhaust 40–60%, jumping 35–60%, charcoal burning 40–50%, pesticides 6–75%, and medication overdose 1.5–4%.[10] The most common attempted methods of suicide differ from the most common successful methods; up to 85% of attempts are via drug overdose in the developed world.[50]</p>
	<p> In China, the consumption of pesticides is the most common method.[106] In Japan, self-disembowelment known as seppuku (or hara-kiri) still occurs;[106] however, hanging and jumping are the most common.[107] Jumping to one's death is common in both Hong Kong and Singapore at 50% and 80% respectively.[10] In Switzerland, firearms are the most frequent suicides method in young males, however this method has decreased relatively since guns have become less common.[108][109] In the United States, 57% of suicides involve the use of firearms, with this method being somewhat more common in men than women.[13] The next most common cause was hanging in males and self-poisoning in females.[13] Together these methods comprised about 40% of U.S. suicides.[110]</p>
	<p> Pathophysiology</p>
	<p> There is no known unifying underlying pathophysiology for either suicide or depression.[13] It is however believed to result from an interplay of behavioral, socio-environmental and psychiatric factors.[10]</p>
	<p> Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are both directly associated with suicide[111] and indirectly associated through its role in major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive–compulsive disorder.[112] Post-mortem studies have found reduced levels of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, in those with and without psychiatric conditions.[113] Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is believed to be low in those who die by suicide. This is partly based on evidence of increased levels of 5-HT2A receptors found after death.[114] Other evidence includes reduced levels of a breakdown product of serotonin, 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in the cerebral spinal fluid.[115] Direct evidence is however hard to gather.[114] Epigenetics, the study of changes in genetic expression in response to environmental factors which do not alter the underlying DNA, is also believed to play a role in determining suicide risk.[116]</p>
	<p> Prevention</p>
	<p> Main article: Suicide prevention</p>
	<p> As a suicide prevention initiative, this sign promotes a special telephone available on the Golden Gate Bridge that connects to a crisis hotline.</p>
	<p> Suicide prevention is a term used for the collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through preventative measures. Reducing access to certain methods, such as firearms or toxins can reduce risk.[10][117] Other measures include reducing access to charcoal (for burning) and barriers on bridges and subway platforms.[10][118] Treatment of drug and alcohol addiction, depression, and those who have attempted suicide in the past may also be effective.[117] Some have proposed reducing access to alcohol as a preventative strategy (such as reducing the number of bars).[35] Although crisis hotlines are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness.[9][119] In young adults who have recently thought about suicide, cognitive behavioral therapy appears to improve outcomes.[120] Economic development through its ability to reduce poverty may be able to decrease suicide rates.[84] Efforts to increase social connection, especially in elderly males, may be effective.[121] The World Suicide Prevention Day is observed annually on September 10 with the support of the International Association for Suicide Prevention and the World Health Organization.[122]</p>
	<p> Screening</p>
	<p> There is little data on the effects of screening the general population on the ultimate rate of suicide.[123][124] Screening those who come to the emergency departments with injuries from self harm have been shown to help identify suicide ideation and suicide intention. Psychometric tests such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale for older people are being used.[125] As there is a high rate of people who test positive via these tools that are not at risk of suicide, there are concerns that screening may significantly increase mental health care resource utilization.[126] Assessing those at high risk however is recommended.[13] Asking about suicidality does not appear to increase the risk.[13]</p>
	<p> Mental illness</p>
	<p> See also: Antidepressants and suicide risk</p>
	<p> In those with mental health problems a number of treatments may reduce the risk of suicide. Those who are actively suicidal may be admitted to psychiatric care either voluntarily or involuntarily.[13] Possessions that may be used to harm oneself are typically removed.[50] Some clinicians get patients to sign suicide prevention contracts where they agree to not harm themselves if released.[13] Evidence however does not support a significant effect from this practice.[13] If a person is at low risk, outpatient mental health treatment may be arranged.[50] Short-term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes in those with borderline personality disorder who are chronically suicidal.[127][128]</p>
	<p> There is tentative evidence that psychotherapy, specifically, dialectical behaviour therapy reduces suicidality in adolescents[129] as well as in those with borderline personality disorder.[130] It may also be useful in decreasing suicide attempts in adults at high risk.[131] Evidence however has not found a decrease in completed suicides.[129]</p>
	<p> There is controversy around the benefit-versus-harm of antidepressants.[34] In young persons, some antidepressants, such as SSRIs, appear to increase the risk of suicidality from 25 per 1000 to 40 per 1000.[132] In older persons, however, they might decrease the risk.[13] Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general population.[133][134] Clozapine may decrease the thoughts of suicide in some people with schizophrenia.[135]</p>
	<p> Epidemiology</p>
	<p> Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, a mortality rate of 11.6 per 100,000 persons per year.[12][13] Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths in 2013 up from 712,000 deaths in 1990.[11] Rates of suicide have increased by 60% from the 1960s to 2012,[117] with these increases seen primarily in the developing world.[4] Globally, as of 2008/2009, suicide is the tenth leading cause of death.[4] For every suicide that results in death there are between 10 and 40 attempted suicides.[13]</p>
	<p> Suicide rates differ significantly between countries and over time.[12] As a percentage of deaths in 2008 it was: Africa 0.5%, South-East Asia 1.9%, Americas 1.2% and Europe 1.4%.[12] Rates per 100,000 were: Australia 8.6, Canada 11.1, China 12.7, India 23.2, United Kingdom 7.6, United States 11.4 and South Korea 28.9.[136][137] It was ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States in 2009 at about 36,000 cases a year,[138] with about 650,000 people seen in emergency departments yearly due to attempting suicide.[13] The country's rate among men in their 50s rose by nearly half in the decade 1999–2010.[139] Lithuania, Japan and Hungary have the highest rates.[12] Around 75% of suicides occur in the developing world.[2] The countries with the greatest absolute numbers of suicides are China and India, accounting for over half the total.[12] In China, suicide is the 5th leading cause of death.[140]</p>

	<p> Globally as of 2012, death by suicide occurs about 1.8 times more often in males than females.[12][141] In the Western world, males die three to four times more often by means of suicide than do females.[12] This difference is even more pronounced in those over the age of 65, with tenfold more males than females dying by suicide.[142] Suicide attempts and self-harm are between two and four times more frequent among females.[13][143][144] Researchers have attributed the difference between attempted and completed suicides among the sexes to males using more lethal means to end their lives.[142][145][146] However, separating intentional suicide attempts from non-suicidal self-harm is not currently done in the United States when gathering statistics at the national level.[147]</p>
	<p> China has one of the highest female suicide rates in the world and is the only country where it is higher than that of men (ratio of 0.9).[12][140] In the Eastern Mediterranean, suicide rates are nearly equivalent between males and females.[12] The highest rate of female suicide is found in South Korea at 22 per 100,000, with high rates in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific generally.[12]</p>
	<p> Due in part to social stigmatisation and the resulting depression, people whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex are at a high risk of suicide.[148]</p>
	<p> A number of reviews have found an increased risk of suicide among transgender, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.[149] Among transgender persons rates of attempted suicide are between 30 and 50%.[150]</p>
	<p> Age</p>
	<p> In many countries the rate of suicide is highest in the middle-aged[151] or elderly.[10] The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due to the number of people in this age group.[12] In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide.[13] It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents[34] and in young males is second only to accidental death.[151] In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality.[151] In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma.[151] In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.[12]</p>
	<p> History</p>
	<p> Main article: History of suicide</p>
	<p> The Death of Seneca (1684), painting by Luca Giordano, depicting the suicide of Seneca the Younger in Ancient Rome</p>
	<p> In ancient Athens, a person who committed suicide without the approval of the state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, on the outskirts of the city, without a headstone or marker.[152] However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat.[153] In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs.[154] Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent.[155] In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.[155]</p>
	<p> Suicide came to be regarded as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, as in the case of martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.[156][157]</p>
	<p> Attitudes towards suicide slowly began to shift during the Renaissance. John Donne's work Biathanatos, contained one of the first modern defences of suicide, bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as Jesus, Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances.[158]</p>
	<p> The secularization of society that began during The Enlightenment questioned traditional religious attitudes toward suicide and brought a more modern perspective to the issue. David Hume denied that suicide was a crime as it affected no one and was potentially to the advantage of the individual. In his 1777 Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul he rhetorically asked, "Why should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me?"[158] A shift in public opinion at large can also be discerned; The Times in 1786 initiated a spirited debate on the motion "Is suicide an act of courage?".[159]</p>
	<p> By the 19th-century, the act of suicide had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by insanity in Europe.[157] Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.</p>
	<p> By 1879, English law began to distinguish between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate.[160] In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England[161] and by the middle of the 20th century, suicide had become legal in much of the western world. The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.[155]</p>

	<p> In most Western countries, suicide is no longer a crime.[20] It was, however, in most Western European countries from the Middle Ages until at least the 1800s.[160] It remains a criminal offense in most Muslim-majority nations.[21]</p>
	<p> In Australia suicide is not a crime.[162] It however is a crime to counsel, incite, or aid and abet another in attempting to die by suicide, and the law explicitly allows any person to use "such force as may reasonably be necessary" to prevent another from taking their own life.[163] The Northern Territory of Australia briefly had legal physician-assisted suicide from 1996 to 1997.[164]</p>
	<p> No country in Europe currently considers suicide or attempted suicide to be a crime.[165] England and Wales decriminalized suicide via the Suicide Act 1961 and the Republic of Ireland in 1993.[165] The word "commit" was used in reference to it being illegal, however many organisations have stopped it because of the negative connotation.[166][167]</p>
	<p> In India, suicide used to be illegal and surviving family could face legal difficulties.[168] The Indian government repealed this law in 2014.[169] In Germany, active euthanasia is illegal and anyone present during suicide may be prosecuted for failure to render aid in an emergency.[170] Switzerland has recently taken steps to legalize assisted suicide for the chronically mentally ill. The high court in Lausanne, Switzerland, in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life.[171]</p>
	<p> In the United States, suicide is not illegal but may be associated with penalties for those who attempt it.[165] Physician-assisted suicide is legal in the state of Washington for people with terminal diseases.[172] In Oregon, people with terminal diseases may request medications to help end their life.[173]</p>
	<p> Canadians who have attempted suicide may be barred from entering the US. US laws allow border guards to deny access to people who have a mental illness, including those with previous suicide attempts.[174][175]</p>
	<p> Religious views</p>
	<p> Main article: Religious views on suicide</p>
	<p> A Hindu widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s</p>
	<p> In most forms of Christianity, suicide is considered a sin, based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages, such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, but suicide was not considered a sin under the Byzantine Christian code of Justinian, for instance.[176][177] In Catholic doctrine, the argument is based on the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" (made applicable under the New Covenant by Jesus in Matthew 19:18), as well as the idea that life is a gift given by God which should not be spurned, and that suicide is against the "natural order" and thus interferes with God's master plan for the world.[178]</p>
	<p> However, it is believed that mental illness or grave fear of suffering diminishes the responsibility of the one completing suicide.[179] Counter-arguments include the following: that the sixth commandment is more accurately translated as "thou shalt not murder" (not necessarily applying to the self), that God has given free will to humans, that taking one's own life no more violates God's Law than does curing a disease and that a number of suicides by followers of God are recorded in the Bible with no dire condemnation.[180]</p>
	<p> Judaism focuses on the importance of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying "to sanctify God's Name" (see Martyrdom). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom, while others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.[181]</p>
	<p> Islamic religious views are against suicide.[21] The Qu'ran forbids it by stating "do not kill or destroy yourself".[182] The hadiths also state individual suicide to be unlawful and a sin.[21] Stigma is often associated with suicide in Islamic countries.[182]</p>
	<p> In Hinduism, suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will become part of the spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not taken one's own life.[183] However, Hinduism accepts a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa.[184] But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.[184] Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or self-immolation by widows, was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.[185]</p>
	<p> Philosophy</p>
	<p> Main article: Philosophy of suicide</p>
	<p> A number of questions are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide.[186] Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from the position that the act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.</p>
	<p> Opponents to suicide include Christian philosophers such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas,[186] Immanuel Kant[187] and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's focus on the importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions.[188] Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma.[189] A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume[186] and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.[171][190]</p>
	<p> Advocacy</p>
	<p> See also: Advocacy of suicide</p>
	<p> In this painting by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, the palette, pistol, and note lying on the floor suggest that the event has just taken place; an artist has taken his own life.[191]</p>
	<p> Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many cultures and subcultures. The Japanese military during World War II encouraged and glorified kamikaze attacks, which were suicide attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific theater of World War II. Japanese society as a whole has been described as "suicide tolerant"[192] (see Suicide in Japan).</p>
	<p> Internet searches for information on suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, either with pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards. The Internet, however, may also help prevent suicide by providing a social group for those who are isolated.[193]</p>
	<p> Locations</p>
	<p> See also: List of suicide sites</p>
	<p> Some landmarks have become known for high levels of suicide attempts.[194] These include San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, Japan's Aokigahara Forest,[195] England's Beachy Head[194] and Toronto's Bloor Street Viaduct.[196]</p>
	<p> As of 2010, the Golden Gate Bridge has had more than 1,300 die by suicide by jumping since its construction in 1937.[197] Many locations where suicide is common have constructed barriers to prevent it;[198] this includes the Luminous Veil in Toronto,[196] the Eiffel Tower in Paris and Empire State Building in New York City.[198] As of 2011, a barrier is being constructed for the Golden Gate Bridge.[199] They appear to be generally effective.[199]</p>
	<p> Notable cases</p>
	<p> Japanese general Hideki Tojo, receiving life-saving treatment immediately after attempted suicide, 1945</p>
	<p> Main article: List of suicides</p>
	<p> An example of mass suicide is the 1978 Jonestown killings/suicide in which 909 members of the Peoples Temple, an American religious group led by Jim Jones, ended their lives by drinking grape Flavor Aid laced with cyanide and various prescription drugs.[200][201][202] Thousands of Japanese civilians took their own lives in the last days of the Battle of Saipan in 1944, some jumping from "Suicide Cliff" and "Banzai Cliff".[203]</p>
	<p> The 1981 hunger strikes, led by Bobby Sands, resulted in 10 deaths. The cause of death was recorded by the coroner as "starvation, self-imposed" rather than suicide; this was modified to simply "starvation" on the death certificates after protest from the dead strikers' families.[204] During World War II, Erwin Rommel was found to have foreknowledge of the July 20 Plot on Hitler's life; he was threatened with public trial, execution and reprisals on his family unless he took his own life.[205]</p>
	<p> Other species</p>
	<p> Main article: Animal suicide</p>
	<p> As suicide requires a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot be said to occur in non-human animals.[153] Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them.[206] Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.[207]</p>
	<p> Pea aphids, when threatened by a ladybug, can explode themselves, scattering and protecting their brethren and sometimes even killing the ladybug.[208] Some species of termites have soldiers that explode, covering their enemies with sticky goo.[209][210]</p>
	<p> There have been anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and dolphins killing themselves, though with little conclusive evidence.[211] There has been little scientific study of animal suicide.[212]</p>`

	eArt: `<p> Theocracy. This is what one calls a government in which a nation is submitted immediately to God, who exercises his sovereignty over her, and who makes her know his will by the organ of the prophets and ministers to whom he is pleased to manifest himself.</p>
	<p> The Hebrew nation provides us with the only example of a true theocracy. This people, whom God had made his inheritance, groaned for a long time under the tyranny of the Egyptians, when the eternal, remembering his promises, resolved to break their bonds and to put them in possession of the land that he had destined for them. He stirred up a prophet for their deliverance, to whom he communicated his will; this was Moses. God chose him to be the liberator of his people and to prescribe for them the laws of which he himself was the author. Moses was only the organ and the interpreter of the will of heaven, he was the minister of God, who had reserved for himself sovereignty over the Israelites; this prophet prescribed to them in his name the worship that they had to follow, and the laws that they had to observe.</p>
	<p> After Moses, the Hebrew people were governed by judges, whom God permitted him to choose. The theocracy did not cease for that reason; the judges were the arbitrators of differences and the generals of armies: assisted by a senate of seventy old men, it was permitted to them neither to make new laws, nor to challenge those which God had prescribed; in extraordinary circumstances, they were obliged to consult the high priest and the prophets, to know the will of heaven. Thus one regulated one’s conduct after the direct inspiration of the Divinity. This theocracy lasted up to the time of Samuel; then the Israelites, through unheard of ingratitude, wearied of being governed by the orders of God himself, they wished, just like the idolatrous nations, to have a king who would command them and who would gain respect for their armies. The prophet Samuel, consulted on this change, addressed himself to the Lord who responded to him I heard the people , it is not you whom they reject, it is myself. Therefore the eternal, in his anger, consents to give them a king; but not without ordering his prophet to announce to these ingrates the inconveniences of this royalty which they prefer to theocracy.</p>
	<p> “Here,” Samuel said to them, “is what will be the rights of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons, and make them carry him on their shoulders; he will traverse the cities in triumph; among your children, some will go by foot in front of him, and the others will follow him like vile slaves; He will force them to join his armies; he will make them serve as laborers in his fields, and reap his harvest; he will choose among them artisans for his luxury and his pomp; he will destine your daughters for vile and base services; he will give your best inheritance to his favorites and his servants; to enrich his courtesans, he will take a tenth of your revenue; finally, you will be his slaves, and it will be useless for you to implore his clemency, because God will not hear you, especially as you are the workers of your own unhappiness.” See Samuel, ch. viii, verse 9. This is how the prophet showed the Israelites the rights which their king would arrogate to himself; such were the threats that God made towards his people, when they wanted to remove themselves from his power and to submit themselves to that of a man. Nevertheless, flattery makes use of the very threats of the prophet in order to turn them into titles for despots. Some perverse and corrupt men pretended that, by these words, the Supreme Being approved of tyranny and gave his sanction to the abuse of power. Although in this way God had made known to the Hebrews the dangers of the power that they were going to give to one among them, they persisted in their demand. “We will be,” they said, “like other nations, we want a king who judges us, and who goes before us against our enemies.” Samuel shows God the obstinacy of his people; the eternal, irritated, only responds with the words, give them a king : the prophet obeys in giving them Saul; this ended the theocracy.</p>
	<p> Although the Israelites were the only people who provide for us the example of a true theocracy, we have nevertheless seen impostors, who, without having the mission of Moses, established over ignorant and captivated peoples an empire that they persuaded them was that of the Divinity. In this way, among the Arabs, Mohammed made himself the prophet, legislator, pontiff, and the sovereign of a crude and subjugated nation; the Koran contains all at once the dogmas, morals, and the civil laws of the Muslims. We know that Mohammed claimed to have received these laws from the mouth of God himself; this so-called theocracy lasted for many centuries under the caliphs, who were the sovereigns and the pontiffs of the Arabs. Among the Japanese, the power of the Dairi, or ecclesiastical emperor, resembled that of a theocracy , before the Cubo , or secular emperor had put boundaries on his authority. One finds vestiges of a similar empire among the ancient Gauls; the druids exercised the functions of priests and judges of the people. Among the Ethiopians and the Egyptians, priests ordered kings to give themselves over to death, when they had displeased the Divinity; in a word there is hardly a country where the priesthood has not made an effort to establish its authority over the souls and bodies of men.</p>
	<p> Although Jesus Christ had declared that his kingdom was not of this world, in centuries of ignorance, one saw the Christian pontiffs struggle to establish their power on the ruins of that of kings. They claimed to place crowns with an authority that only belonged to the sovereign of the universe.</p>
	<p> Those were the pretensions and maxims of Gregory VII, Boniface VIII, and many other Roman pontiffs, who profiting from the superstitious stupidity of the people, armed them against their natural sovereigns, and covered Europe with carnage and horrors. It is over these bloody cadavers of many millions of Christians that the representatives of the God of peace raised the edifice of a chimerical power, of which men were for a long time sad toys and miserable victims. In general, history and experience prove to us that the priesthood always endeavors to introduce on the earth a type of theocracy ; priests only want to submit themselves to God, that invisible sovereign of nature, or to one from among themselves, whom they have chosen to represent the Divinity; they wanted to form in the estates a separate estate, independent from the civil power; they claimed to hold only from the Divinity the goods that men had obviously placed into their possession. It is left to the wisdom of sovereigns to repress these ambitious and idealistic pretentions, and to contain all members of society within the just boundaries that reason and the tranquility of the states prescribe.</p>
	<p> A modern author regarded theocracy as the first form of government that all nations had adopted; he claimed that, following the example of the universe, which is governed by one sole God, men gathered together in society would want no other monarch than the Supreme Being. As man had only imperfect and human ideas of this celestial monarch, he raised up for him a palace, a temple, a sanctuary, and a throne and gave to him officers and ministers. He was not slow to represent the invisible God of the society by emblems and symbols that indicated some of his attributes; little by little they forgot that which the symbol designated, and they gave to the symbol that which was due only to the Divinity that it represented; that was the origin of idolatry which the priests, failing to instruct the people, or out of self-interest, themselves produced. These priests had no trouble governing men in the name of mute and inanimate idols of which they were the ministers; a dreadful superstition covered the face of the earth under this priestly government, it infinitely multiplied sacrifices, offerings, in a word, all practices useful to the visible ministers of a hidden Divinity. The priests, prideful of their power, abused it strangely; that was their incontinence. Which, according to the author, gave birth to this race of men who claim to be descendents of gods, and who are known in mythology by the name of demigods. Men, exhausted by the insupportable yoke of the ministers of theocracy , wished to have among themselves living symbols of the Divinity, they therefore chose kings, who would be for them the representatives of the invisible monarch – Soon they gave to them the same honors that they had given before to the symbols of theocracy ; they were treated as gods, and they treated men as slaves, who, believing to be always submitted to the Supreme Being, forgot to restrain by advantageous laws the power that these weak images could abuse. According to the author, there is the true source of despotism, that is to say of this arbitrary and tyrannical government under which the people of Asia still groan today, without daring to reclaim the rights of nature and of reason, which will for man to be governed by his happiness.</p>`,

	<h4> Synopsis</h4>
	<p> In some religions, the ruler, usually a king, was regarded as the chosen favorite of God (or gods) who could not be questioned, sometimes even being the descendant of, or a god in their own right. Today, there is also a form of government where clerics have the power and the supreme leader could not be questioned in action. From the perspective of the theocratic government, "God himself is recognized as the head" of the state, hence the term theocracy, from the Koine Greek θεοκρατία "rule of God", a term used by Josephus for the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Taken literally or strictly, theocracy means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal "rule of the heart", especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.</p>
	<p> In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example, Moses led the Israelites, and Muhammad led the early Muslims. There is a fine line between the tendency of appointing religious characters to run the state and having a religious-based government. According to the Holy Books, Prophet Joseph was offered an essential governmental role just because he was trustworthy, wise and knowledgeable (Quran 12: 54–55). As a result of the Prophet Joseph's knowledge and also due to his ethical and genuine efforts during a critical economic situation, the whole nation was rescued from a seven-year drought (Quran 12: 47–48). When religions have a "holy book," it is used as a direct message from God. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. As to the Prophet Muhammad ruling, "The first thirteen of the Prophet's twenty-three year career went on totally apolitical and non-violent. This attitude partly changed only after he had to flee from Mecca to Medina.This hijra, or migration, would be a turning point in the Prophet's mission and would mark the very beginning of the Muslim calendar. Yet, interestingly, the Prophet did not establish a theocracy in Medina. Instead of a polity defined solely by Islam, he founded a territorial polity based on religious pluralism. This is evident in a document called the ’Charter of Medina’, which the Prophet signed with the leaders of the other community in the city." According to the Quran, Prophets were not after power or material resources. For example in surah 26 verses (109, 127, 145, 164, 180), the Koran repeatedly quotes from Prophets, Noah, Hud, Salih, Lut, and Shu'aib that: ” I do not ask you for it any payment; my payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.” While, in theocracy many aspects of the holy book are overshadowed by material powers. Due to be considered divine, the regime entitles itself to interpret verses to its own benefit and abuse them out of the context for its political aims. An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation. For example, the prince-bishops of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two 'arms'—administrators and clergy—but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the Papal States occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.</p>
	<p> Theocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a state religion, or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held "By the Grace of God". In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion (e.g., the Byzantine emperor as patron and defender of the official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a caesaropapist regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now Anglican hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.</p>
	<p> Secular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in Israel marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Etymology</h4>
	<p> The word theocracy originates from the Greek θεοκρατία meaning "the rule of God". This in turn derives from θεός (theos), meaning "god", and κρατέω (krateo), meaning "to rule." Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was "rule by god(s)" or human incarnation(s) of god(s).</p>
	<p> The term was initially coined by Flavius Josephus in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government of the Jews. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following three types: monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy. The government of the Jews, however, was unique. Josephus offered the term "theocracy" to describe this polity, ordained by Moses, in which God is sovereign and his word is law.</p>
	<p> Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the Enlightenment era, when the term started to collect more universalistic and negative connotations, especially in Hegel's hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning "sacerdotal government under divine inspiration" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning "priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power" is recorded from 1825.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Current theocracies</h4>
	<h3> Christian theocracies</h3>
	<h2> Holy See (Vatican City)</h3>
	<p> Following the Capture of Rome on 20 September 1870, the Papal States including Rome with the Vatican were annexed by the Kingdom of Italy. In 1929, with the Lateran Treaty signed with the Italian Government, the new state of Vatican City (population 842) – with no connection with the former Papal States – was formally created and recognized as an independent state. The head of state of the Vatican is the pope, elected by the College of Cardinals, an assembly of Senatorial-princes of the Church, who are usually clerics, appointed as Ordinaries, but in the past have also included men who were not bishops nor clerics. A pope is elected for life, and either dies or may resign.</p>
	<p> Voting is limited to cardinals under 80 years of age. A Secretary for Relations with States, directly responsible for international relations, is appointed by the pope. The Vatican legal system is rooted in canon law but ultimately is decided by the pope; the Bishop of Rome as the Supreme Pontiff, "has the fullness of legislative, executive and judicial powers." Although the laws of Vatican City come from the secular laws of Italy, under article 3 of the Law of the Sources of the Law, provision is made for the supplementary application of the “laws promulgated by the Kingdom of Italy.” The government of the Vatican can also be considered an ecclesiocracy (ruled by the Church).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Islamic states or Islamic theocracies</h3>
	<p> An Islamic state is a state that has adopted Islam, specifically Sharia, as its foundations for political institutions, or laws, exclusively, and has implemented the Islamic ruling system khilafah (Arabic: خلافة), and is therefore a theocracy. Although there is much debate as to which states or groups operate strictly according to Islamic Law, Sharia is the official basis for state laws in the following countries: Afghanistan, Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen. In Nigeria, the constitution provides that states may elect to use Shari'a laws and courts, though non-Muslims are not required in any state to submit to Shari'a jurisdiction and adherence varies by state.</p>
	<p> Pakistan has Islam as its only official religion and its Federal Shariat Court has the duty of striking down any law not complying with the Sharia code of Islamic law; however, ruling falls upon legal scholars who, while required to be Muslim, are not religious clerics, and their judgements can be overruled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which can be and has been on occasion headed by a non-Muslim.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Iran</h2>
	<p> Iran has been described as a "theocratic republic" (by the US Central Intelligence Agency), and its constitution a "hybrid" of "theocratic and democratic elements" by Francis Fukuyama. Like other Islamic states, it maintains religious laws and has religious courts to interpret all aspects of law. According to Iran's constitution, "all civil, penal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and other laws and regulations must be based on Islamic criteria."</p>
	<p> In addition, Iran has a religious ruler and many religious officials in powerful government posts. The head of state, or "Supreme Leader", is a faqih (scholar of Islamic law), and possesses more power than Iran's president. The Leader appoints the heads of many powerful posts: the commanders of the armed forces, the director of the national radio and television network, the heads of the powerful major religious foundations, the chief justice, the attorney general (indirectly through the chief justice), special tribunals, and members of national security councils dealing with defence and foreign affairs. He also co-appoints the 12 jurists of the Guardian Council.</p>
	<p> The Leader is elected by the Assembly of Experts which is made up of mujtahids, who are Islamic scholars competent in interpreting Sharia.</p>
	<p> Another body, the Council of Guardians, has the power to veto bills from majlis (parliament), approve or disapprove candidates who wish to run for high office (president, majlis, the Assembly of Experts). The council supervises elections, and can greenlight or ban investigations into the election process. Six of the Guardians (half the council) are faqih empowered to approve or veto all bills from the majlis (parliament) according to whether the faqih believe them to be in accordance with Islamic law and customs (Sharia). The other six members are lawyers appointed by the head of the judiciary (who is also a cleric and also appointed by the Leader).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Central Tibetan Administration</h3>
	<p> The Central Tibetan Administration, colloquially known as the Tibetan government in exile, is a Tibetan exile organisation with a state-like internal structure. According to its charter, the position of head of state of the Central Tibetan Administration belongs ex officio to the current Dalai Lama, a religious hierarch. In this respect, it continues the traditions of the former government of Tibet, which was ruled by the Dalai Lamas and their ministers, with a specific role reserved for a class of monk officials.</p>
	<p> On March 14, 2011, at the 14th Dalai Lama's suggestion, the parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration began considering a proposal to remove the Dalai Lama's role as head of state in favor of an elected leader.</p>
	<p> The first directly elected Kalön Tripa was Samdhong Rinpoche, who was elected August 20, 2001.</p>
	<p> Before 2011, the Kalön Tripa position was subordinate to the 14th Dalai Lama who presided over the government in exile from its founding. In August of that year, Lobsang Sangay polled 55 per cent votes out of 49,189, defeating his nearest rival Tethong Tenzin Namgyal by 8,646 votes, becoming the second popularly elected Kalon Tripa. The Dalai Lama announced that his political authority would be transferred to Sangay.</p>

	<p> On September 20, 2012, the 15th Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile unanimously voted to change the title of Kalön Tripa to Sikyong in Article 19 of the Charter of the Tibetans in exile and relevant articles. The Dalai Lama had previously referred to the Kalon Tripa as Sikyong, and this usage was cited as the primary justification for the name change. According to Tibetan Review, "Sikyong" translates to "political leader", as distinct from "spiritual leader". Foreign affairs Kalon Dicki Chhoyang stated that the term "Sikyong" has had a precedent dating back to the 7th Dalai Lama, and that the name change "ensures historical continuity and legitimacy of the traditional leadership from the fifth Dalai Lama". The online Dharma Dictionary translates sikyong (srid skyong) as "secular ruler; regime, regent." The title sikyong had previously been used by regents who ruled Tibet during the Dalai Lama's minority.</p>

	<h3> States with official state religion</h3>
	<p> Having a state religion is not sufficient to be a theocracy in the narrow sense. Many countries have a state religion without the government directly deriving its powers from a divine authority or a religious authority directly exercising governmental powers. Since the narrow sense has few instances in the modern world, the more common usage is the wider sense of an enforced state religion.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Historic states with theocratic aspects</h4>
	<h3> Tibet</h3>
	<p> Unified religious rule in Tibet began in 1642, when the Fifth Dalai Lama allied with the military power of the Mongol Gushri Khan to consolidate the political power and center control around his office as head of the Gelug school. This form of government is known as the dual system of government. Prior to 1642, particular monasteries and monks had held considerable power throughout Tibet, but had not achieved anything approaching complete control, though power continued to be held in a diffuse, feudal system after the ascension of the Fifth Dalai Lama. Power in Tibet was held by a number of traditional elites, including members of the nobility, the heads of the major Buddhist sects (including their various tulkus), and various large and influential monastic communities.</p>
	<p> Political power was sometimes used by monastic leaders to suppress rival religious schools through the confiscation of property and direct violence. Social mobility was somewhat possible through the attainment of a monastic education, or recognition as a reincarnated teacher, but such institutions were dominated by the traditional elites and governed by political intrigue. Non-Buddhists in Tibet were members of an outcast underclass.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> China</h3>
	<p> Similar to the Roman Emperor, the Chinese sovereign was historically held to be the Son of Heaven. However, from the first historical Emperor on, this was largely ceremonial and tradition quickly established it as a posthumous dignity, like the Roman institution. The situation before Qin Shi Huang Di is less clear.</p>
	<p> The Shang dynasty essentially functioned as a theocracy, declaring the ruling family the sons of heaven and calling the chief sky god Shangdi after a word for their deceased ancestors. After their overthrow by the Zhou, the royal clan of Shang were not eliminated but instead moved to a ceremonial capital where they were charged to continue the performance of their rituals.</p>
	<p> The titles combined by Shi Huangdi to form his new title of emperor were originally applied to god-like beings who ordered the heavens and earth and to culture heroes credited with the invention of agriculture, clothing, music, astrology, &c. Even after the fall of Qin, an emperor's words were considered sacred edicts (聖旨) and his written proclamations "directives from above" (上諭).</p>
	<p> As a result, some Sinologists translate the title huangdi (usually rendered "emperor") as thearch. The term properly refers to the head of a thearchy (a kingdom of gods), but the more accurate "theocrat" carries associations of a strong priesthood that would be generally inaccurate in describing imperial China. Others reserve the use of "thearch" to describe the legendary figures of Chinese prehistory while continuing to use "emperor" to describe historical rulers.</p>
	<p> The Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace in 1860s Qing China was a heterodox Christian theocracy led by a person who said that he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ, Hong Xiuquan. This theocratic state fought one of the most destructive wars in history, the Taiping Rebellion, against the Qing Dynasty for fifteen years before being crushed following the fall of the rebel capital Nanjing.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Caliphate</h3>
	<p> The Sunni branch of Islam stipulates that, as a head of state, a Caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives. Followers of Shia Islam, however, believe a Caliph should be an Imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (the "Family of the House", Muhammad's direct descendants).</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Byzantine Empire</h3>
	<p> The Byzantine Empire (a.d. 324–1453) operated under caesaropapism, meaning that the emperor was both the head of civil society and the ultimate authority over the ecclesiastical authorities, or patriarchates. The emperor was considered to be God's omnipotent representative on earth and he ruled as an absolute autocrat.</p>
	<p> Jennifer Fretland VanVoorst argues, “the Byzantine Empire became a theocracy in the sense that Christian values and ideals were the foundation of the empire's political ideals and heavily entwined with its political goals”. Steven Runciman says in his book on The Byzantine Theocracy (2004):</p>
	<p> The constitution of the Byzantine Empire was based on the conviction that it was the earthly copy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Just as God ruled in Heaven, so the Emperor, made in His image, should rule on earth and carry out his commandments....It saw itself as a universal empire. Ideally, it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who, ideally, should all be members of the one true Christian Church, its own Orthodox Church. Just as man was made in God's image, so man's kingdom on Earth was made in the image of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
	<h3> Geneva and Zurich</h3>
	<p> Historians debate the extent to which Geneva, Switzerland, in the days of John Calvin (1509–64) was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's theology clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.</p>
	<p> In nearby Zurich, Switzerland, Protestant reformer Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531) built a political system that many scholars have called a theocracy, while others have denied it.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Deseret</h3>
	<p> The question of theocracy has been debated at extensively by historians regarding the Mormon communities in Illinois, and especially in Utah.</p>
	<p> Joseph Smith, mayor of Nauvoo, Illinois, and founder of the Mormon movement, ran as an independent for president in 1844. He proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands; reducing the size and salary of Congress; the closure of prisons; the annexation of Texas, Oregon, and parts of Canada; the securing of international rights on high seas; free trade; and the re-establishment of a national bank. His top aide Brigham Young campaigned for Smith saying, "He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution." The campaign ended when Smith was killed by a mob while in the Carthage, Illinois, jail on June 27, 1844.</p>
	<p> After severe persecution, the Mormons left the United States and resettled in a remote part of Utah, which was then part of Mexico. However the United States took control in 1848 and would not accept polygamy. The Mormon State of Deseret was short-lived. Its original borders stretched from western Colorado to the southern California coast. When the Mormons arrived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847, the Great Basin was still a part of Mexico and had no secular government. As a result, Brigham Young administered the region both spiritually and temporally through the highly organized and centralized Melchizedek Priesthood. This original organization was based upon a concept called theodemocracy, a governmental system combining Biblical theocracy with mid-19th-century American political ideals.</p>
	<p> In 1849, the Saints organized a secular government in Utah, although many ecclesiastical leaders maintained their positions of secular power. The Mormons also petitioned Congress to have Deseret admitted into the Union as a state. However, under the Compromise of 1850, Utah Territory was created and Brigham Young was appointed governor. In this situation, Young still stood as head of the LDS Church as well as Utah's secular government.</p>
	<p> After the abortive Utah War of 1857–1858, the replacement of Young by an outside Federal Territorial Governor, intense federal prosecution of LDS Church leaders, and the eventual resolution of controversies regarding plural marriage, and accession by Utah to statehood, the apparent temporal aspects of LDS theodemocracy receded markedly.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Western Antiquity</h3>
	<p> The imperial cults in Ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire, as well as numerous other monarchies, deified the ruling monarch. The state religion was often dedicated to the worship of the ruler as a deity, or the incarnation thereof.</p>
	<p> Early Israel was ruled by Judges before instituting a monarchy. The Judges were believed to be representatives of YHVH Yahweh (also translated as, Jehovah).</p>
	<p> In ancient and medieval Christianity, Caesaropapism is the doctrine where a head of state is at the same time the head of the church.
	<br>
	<h3> Persia</h3>
	<p> During the Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrianism was the state religion and included formalized worship. The Persian kings were known to be pious Zoroastrians and also ruled with a Zoroastrian form of law called asha. However, Cyrus the Great, who founded the empire, avoided imposing the Zoroastrian faith on the inhabitants of conquered territory. Cyrus's kindness towards Jews has been cited as sparking Zoroastrian influence on Judaism.</p>
	<p> Under the Seleucids, Zoroastrianism became autonomous. During the Sassanid period, the Zoroastrian calendar was reformed, image-use was banned, Fire Temples were increasingly built and intolerance towards other faiths prevailed.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Others</h3>
	<p> The short reign (1494–1498) of Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican priest, over the city of Florence had features of a theocracy. During his rule, "un-Christian" books, statues, poetry, and other items were burned (in the Bonfire of the Vanities), sodomy was made a capital offense, and other Christian practices became law.</p>`

	eArt: `THEOLOGY, Theologia, from the Greek θεὸς, God , and λόγος , discourse , taken in general, is the science of God and divine things, as one may know them by natural lights. It is in this sense that Aristotle (Metaphysics , 1, vi) calls theology that part of philosophy that is concerned with God and some of his attributes. It is in this same sense that the Pagans gave their poets the name of theologians, because they regarded them as more enlightened than the common man on the nature of divinity & on the mysteries of religion.
	<p> The ancients had three sorts of theology : 1. Mythology or the fabulous that flourished among Poets, and that principally ruled over theogony, or the generation of the gods. See Fable, Mythology , and Theogony. 2. Political Theology embraced principally by princes, magistrates, priests, and the body of the people, as the most useful and most necessary science for the security, tranquility and prosperity of the state. 3. Physical or natural Theology , cultivated by the Philosophes , is the science most suited to nature and to reason, accepting only a sole supreme God, and demons or genies as mediators between God and men. See Demon, Genie.</p>
	<p> The Hebrews, who had favored revelation, also have their Theologians, for that name can be given to the Prophets raised by God to instruct them, to pontiffs charged by the state with explaining the law, & scribes or doctors who professed to interpret it. Since their dispersal, modern Jews have not lacked theological writers or books; the writings of their rabbis are spread throughout the world. See Rabbis and Talmud.</p>
	<p> Among Christians the word Theology is taken in various ways. The ancient fathers, and particularly Greeks like S. Basil and St. Gregory of Nazianzus, gave this name especially to that part of the Christian doctrine that deals with divinity; hence they call St. John the Evangelist the theologian par excellence, because he dealt with the divinity of the Word in a manner more profound and extended than the other apostles. They also call St. Gregory of Nazianzus “the theologian ” because he defended with zeal the divinity of the Word against the Arians, and in this sense the Greeks distinguished theology from what they called economy, that is to say, the part of the Christian doctrine that deals with the mystery of the Incarnation.</p>
	<p> But in a broader sense, Theology is defined as a science that teaches us what we ought to believe about God and the way He wants us to serve Him; it is divided into two kinds: Natural Theology and Supernatural Theology.</p>
	<p> Natural theology is the knowledge we have of God and his attributes, by the sole light of reason and nature, and in consideration of the works that could only come from his hands. Supernatural theology (or theology properly speaking) is a science founded on revealed principles that draws conclusions about both God, his nature, attributes, etc, and about all the other things that can relate to God; hence it follows that theology joins in its way of proceeding the use of reason with the certitude of revelation that it is founded in part on the light of revelation and in part on that of reason.</p>
	<p> All the truths that Theology proposes the search for and study of, are either speculative or practical, in this respect dividing the subject into speculative theology and practical or moral theology. Speculative theology has the sole aim of clarifying, fixing and defending the dogmas of religion insofar as they should be believed. Practical or moral theology is concerned with fixing religious duties, by treating virtues and vices, prescribing rules, and deciding what is just or unjust, licit or illicit, in the order of religion.</p>
	<p> As for the manner of treating Theology, people distinguish between positive and scholastic. Positive Theology has the goal of expounding and proving the truths of religion by scriptural tesxs, in line with the tradition of the Church Fathers and the decisions of councils, without being attached to the scholastic methods but treating them in a rhetorical style, as did the Church Fathers.</p>
	<p> Scholastic Theology employs dialectics, arguments, and the forms commonly used in the schools to deal with religious matters.</p>
	<p> Some authors think that the difference found between positive and scholastic Theology does not come from a difference of style and elocution, in a word, from a scholastic form proper to the latter that is not found in the former. They say that scholastic Theologians have enclosed in a single body and placed in a certain order all questions regarding doctrine, instead of which the ancients did not deal with religious dogma, except separately and on occasion. But this does not pertain to style, for the moderns could have treated the whole religious plane in rhetorical style, and the ancients could have dealt only with some questions in scholastic style. The true difference between positive and scholastic therefore depends on the stylistic form, since the subject matter is the same.</p>
	<p> Luther called s cholastic Theology a “two-faced discipline , composed of a mixture of Holy Scripture and philosophical reasons. Mixtione quadam ex divinis eloquiis & philosphicis rationibus tanquam ex centayrorum genere biformis disciplina conflata est. ” But as we will see later, he had only a false idea of it and he was judging it by its abuses.</p>
	<p> Abbot Fleury in his fifth discourse on ecclesiastical history does not appear any more favorable to scholasticism, for after its being objected that if it is not true that the scholastics had found a more commodious and more exact method for teaching Theology, although their style is no more solid or more precise than the ancients’, to which he responded:</p>
	<p> “I have often heard it said (but I cannot agree and I will never be persuaded of it) that until the twelfth century method was lacking in Christian schools. It is true that the ancients did not make an entire course of Theology, as did Hugo of St. Victor, Robert Pullus, Hildebert de Tours, and so many others. But they did not neglect to give us in their works the entire plan of religion, like St. Augustine, who in his Enchiridion shows all that one should believe (& the way of teaching it) in his book on Christian doctrine. One even finds an abbreviated morality in several other treatises, such as St. Clement of Alexandria’s pedagogy.</p>
	<p> So what is lacking among the ancients? Is it each giving his entire course of Theology , always starting with the division and definition of the same subjects? I admit that the moderns have done this, but I do not agree that religion has been better taught for it. The most palpable effect of this method is to have filled with world with an infinity of volumes (partly printed, partly still in manuscript) that remain dormant in the great libraries because they do not attract readers either by their utility or agreement – for who today reads Alexander of Hales or Albert the Great?”</p>
	<p> And he had previously remarked that he saw nothing great in the latter —other than the thickness and number of the volumes.</p>
	<p> He then observes that the scholastics claimed to follow the method of geometricians, but this was not so, for they often took Scripture in figurative and altered senses, posed as principles the axioms of a bad philosophy, or one based on the authority of some profane author. Then he adds:</p>
	<p> “While the scholastics imitated the method of geometricians, they copied their dry and uniform style even better. They indulged in another fault by making a particular language distinct from all vulgar tongues and from true Latin, although nominally its origin. This was not at all necessary, since each person can philosophize by speaking his own tongue well. Aristotle’s writings are in good Greek, the philosophical works of Cicero in good Latin, and in the last century Descartes explained his doctrine in good French...</p>
	<p> Another error is to believe that a dry, constrained, and uniform style is more clear and more concise than ordinary and natural discourse, where one gives oneself the freedom to vary sentences and to use some images. But this restrained and pre-molded style, so to speak, is prolix as well as being very annoying. On each page they repeat the same formulas: for example, on the subject six questions are posed; on the first, one proceeds thus, then three objections, then I answer what should be said, etc., and then come the answers to the objections. You will say that the author is obliged by inevitable necessity to express himself always the same. On each line they repeat the terms of the art: proposition, assertion, major, minor, proof, conclusions, etc – and these repetitions lengthen the discourse very much...</p>
	<p> In form, the arguments again lengthen the discourse noticeably, and make the person who sees the conclusion right away impatient. He is comforted by an enthymeme or by a simple proposition that underlies all the rest. It would be better to reserve entire syllogisms for rare occasions when one must develop a specious sophism or make an abstract truth perceptible.</p>
	<p> However, those who are accustomed to the scholastic style do not recognize reasonings unless they are presented in a syllogistic form. The Church Fathers appear to them rhetoricians, or even windbags, because they explain things naturally, as is done in conversation, because they sometimes use questions, exclamations, and other ordinary figures of speech. The scholastics do not see that figures and ingenious turns of phrase save many words, or that often by a well placed work one prevents or overcomes an objection that would occupy them for a long time.”</p>
	<p> These accusations are serious and one can scarcely say worse of scholasticism; but they pertain only to ancient scholasticism, disfigured by frivolous questions and a barbarous style. For it must be agreed that since the renewal of studies in the sixteenth centaury, scholasticism has changed form in these two respects. In effect, to consider it from its veritable standpoint, it is merely the knowledge of divine Scripture interpreted following the meaning the Church approves, by joining together the explanations and censures of the fathers, without neglecting the help that can be drawn from the secular sciences to clarify and sustain the truth. Scholastica theologia est divinarum scriptuarum peritia, recepto quem ecclesia approbat sensu, non spretis orthodoxorum doctorum interpretationibus & censuris, interdum aliarum disiplinarum non contempto suffragio. It is thus that the theology faculty of Paris has known it, who cultivate it on these principles, and whose goal in exercising its students is to accustom them to right reasoning by the use of dialectics.</p>
	<p> In effect, subtract from scholasticism a great number of futile questions that overtaxed the ancients, remove the abuses of their method, & reduce it to dealing in order with the interesting truths of dogma and morality, and you will find that it as ancient as the church. So many polemic and dogmatic works by the fathers of all centuries, in which they establish the various dogmas of religion attacked by the heretics are an incontestable proof of this. For if they were not content to simply expound the faith of the Church by bringing passages from Scripture and the Fathers on which it is founded, but they also employed dialectics and reasoning to establish the veritable meaning of passages they cited in order to explain those that are put forward by their adversaries, to refute the difficulties they raise, to clarify and develop the consequences of the principles they find established in Holy Scripture and in tradition, to convict of error the false consequences drawn by the heretics; and finally they would neglect noting of that may serve to make the truth known, clarified, and sustained, to persuade those who are not convinced of it, and to remove from error those who are engaged in it; to succeed, they employ the principles of natural reason, the science of languages, the subtleties of dialectic, the traits of eloquence, and the authority of philosophers and of historians. One finds in their writing propositions, proofs, objections, responses, arguments, consequences, etc.; thus the whole difference comes from the method of the moderns being less hidden, and they are not (or do not affect to be) so eloquent. But at bottom, are they less solid when they stick to essential points and treat them according to the great principles as modern scholastics do, especially in the theology faculty of Paris? The defects of a nascent method do not always prove that it is bad, and often elevate those who have perfected it.</p>
	<p> Theologians have the habit of treating several questions relating to the dignity, utility, and necessity of the science they are professing, and on all these topics we will refer the reader to their writings. We content ourselves with touching what concerns the certitude of Theology, or theological conclusions. By theological conclusions we mean those that are evidently and certainly deduced from one or two premises, either when both are revealed, or when one is revealed and the other simply known by natural lights; one wonders 1) if these conclusions are of an equal certitude as propositions that go without saying; 2) if they are more or less certain that the conclusions of other sciences; 3) if they equal in certitude the first principles or axioms of geometry, philosophy etc.</p>
	<p> Deciding all these questions depends on knowing the foundation of the certitude of theological conclusions, that is to say, what motive determines to mind to acquiesce. It is generally agreed that the immediate revelation of God proposed by the Church is the motive that leads to acquiescing in the truths of faith; virtual or mediate revelation, that is to say, the connection that is found between a theological conclusion and revelation, a connection manifested by natural lights, is the motive that brings acquiescence to theological conclusions.</p>
	<p> Form there it is easy to infer: 1) That purely theological conclusions do not have the same degree of certitude as the verities of faith, the latter being founded on a) the immediate revelation of God; and b) the decision of the Church that attest the truth of this revelation, instead of which theological conclusions have only the motive of their connection with revelation, but the connection is perceived only by the lights of reason; the motive of acquiescence and the means of knowing these motive lie , as we see, in the theological conclusions of an inferior order to the motive that determines the mind to subject itself to the verities of faith and to the means that uncover this motive. 2) That theological conclusions are more certain than the conclusions of the natural sciences taken in general, because one knows that the latter often rest only on conjectures and that their connection with first principles is not so evident as that of theological conclusions with immediate revelation.</p>
	<p> But opinion is divided on the third question, whether theological conclusions are more or less certain than first principles of geometry and philosophy, and on this point there are two opinions.</p>
	<p> The first is that of ancient theologians who maintain that theological conclusions are more certain than first principles because, they say, they rely on God’s revelation and so cannot and will not deceive men, instead of which the certainty of first principles is founded only on reason or natural light, which is subject to error.</p>
	<p> On the contrary, most moderns think that first principles are as certain as theological conclusions because: 1) Such is the certitude of these axioms - “the whole is grater than the sum of its parts,” “two things equal to a third are equal to each other,” etc. – that it is impossible to assign them any greater certainty, and one feels by experience that there are no truths with which the mind agrees more readily. 2) Because God is no less the author of reason than revelation, from which it follows that if one cannot suspect revelation of falsity, from fear of making the reproach fall on God Himself, one cannot suspect reason of error concerning first principles, since God gave us these two equal means, one of knowing natural truths, the other for adhering to the verities of faith. 3) Because faith itself is in some way supported by reason: for, (they say) why do we believe in revelation? Because we know that God is in essence the truth that cannot either deceive or be deceived. And who is it that shows us this truth? Reason, no doubt – it is also that which by various motives of credibility persuades us that Jesus Christ is the messiah, and that his religion is the only veritable one. If then reason leads us by the hand to faith and if it is in some way the foundation of it, why would one want theological conclusions (that one admits to be less certain than the verities of faith) to be more so than the axioms and first principles of Reason (Holden, de Resolut. Fidei , I, I, ch 3 & Element. Theolog. Ch. 1, pg 12).</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> Theology is the critical study of the nature of the divine. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries and schools of divinity.</p>

		<h4> Definition</h4>
		<p> Augustine of Hippo defined the Latin equivalent, theologia, as "reasoning or discussion concerning the Deity"; Richard Hooker defined "theology" in English as "the science of things divine". The term can, however, be used for a variety of different disciplines or fields of study. Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (philosophical, ethnographic, historical, spiritual and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any of myriad religious topics. Specifically, the study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition,  another religious tradition,  or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to propagate,  reform,  or justify a religious tradition or it may be used to compare,  challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or world-view. Theology might also help a theologian to address some present situation or need through a religious tradition,  or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world. </p>
		<br>
		<h4> Etymology</h4>
		<p> • Theology translates into English from the Greek theologia (θεολογία) which derived from Τheos (Θεός), meaning "God," and -logia (-λογία), meaning "utterances, sayings, or oracles" (a word related to logos , meaning "word, discourse, account, or reasoning") which had passed into Latin as theologia and into French as théologie. The English equivalent "theology" (Theologie, Teologye) had evolved by 1362. The sense the word has in English depends in large part on the sense the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in Patristic and medieval Christian usage, though the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.</p>
		<p> • Greek theologia (θεολογία) was used with the meaning "discourse on god" in the fourth century BC by Plato in The Republic, Book ii, Ch. 18. Aristotle divided theoretical philosophy into mathematike, physike and theologike, with the latter corresponding roughly to metaphysics, which, for Aristotle, included discourse on the nature of the divine.</p>
		<p> • Drawing on Greek Stoic sources, the Latin writer Varro distinguished three forms of such discourse: mythical (concerning the myths of the Greek gods), rational (philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology) and civil (concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance).</p>
		<p> • Theologos, closely related to theologia, appears once in some biblical manuscripts, in the heading to the book of Revelation: apokalypsis ioannoy toy theologoy, "the revelation of John the theologos." There, however, the word refers not to John the "theologian" in the modern English sense of the word but—using a slightly different sense of the root logos, meaning not "rational discourse" but "word" or "message"—one who speaks the words of God, logoi toy theoy.</p>
		<p> • Some Latin Christian authors, such as Tertullian and Augustine, followed Varro's threefold usage, though Augustine also used the term more simply to mean 'reasoning or discussion concerning the deity'</p>
		<p> • In Patristic Greek Christian sources, theologia could refer narrowly to devout and inspired knowledge of, and teaching about, the essential nature of God.</p>
		<p> • The Latin author Boethius, writing in the early 6th century, used theologia to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality (as opposed to physica, which deals with corporeal, moving realities). Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.</p>
		<p> • In scholastic Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the doctrines of the Christian religion, or (more precisely) the academic discipline which investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in Peter Lombard's Sentences, a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).</p>
		<p> • In the Renaissance, especially with Florentine Platonist apologists of Dante's poetics, the distinction between "poetic theology" (theologia poetica) and "revealed" or Biblical theology serves as steppingstone for a revival of philosophy as independent of theological authority.</p>
		<p> • It is in this last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the fourteenth century, though it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God – a discourse now sometimes called Theology Proper.</p>
		<p> • From the 17th century onwards, it also became possible to use the term 'theology' to refer to study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian (e.g., in the term 'natural theology' which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation), or that are specific to another religion (see below).</p>
		<p> • "Theology" can also now be used in a derived sense to mean "a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology."</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Various religions</h4>
		<p> The term Theology has been deemed by some as only appropriate to the study of religions that worship a supposed deity (a theos), i.e. more widely than the Judeo-Christian tradition; and presuppose a belief in the ability to speak and reason about this deity (in logia). They suggest the term is less appropriate in religious contexts that are organized differently (religions without a single deity, or that deny that such subjects can be studied logically). ("Hierology" has been proposed as an alternative, more generic term.)</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Analogous discourses</h3>
		<p> Allamah Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi was the most influential Islamic theologian of the 20th century.</p>
		<p> Islamic theological discussion that parallels Christian theological discussion is named "Kalam"; the Islamic analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be the investigation and elaboration of Sharia or Fiqh. "Kalam... does not hold the leading place in Muslim thought that theology does in Christianity. To find an equivalent for 'theology' in the Christian sense it is necessary to have recourse to several disciplines, and to the usul al-fiqh as much as to kalam." (L. Gardet)</p>
		<p> Some academic inquiries within Buddhism, dedicated to the rational investigation of a Buddhist understanding of the world, prefer the designation Buddhist philosophy to the term Buddhist theology, since Buddhism lacks the same conception of a theos. Jose Ignacio Cabezon, who argues that the use of "theology" is appropriate, can only do so, he says, because "I take theology not to be restricted to discourse on God... I take 'theology' not to be restricted to its etymological meaning. In that latter sense, Buddhism is of course atheological, rejecting as it does the notion of God."</p>
		<p> Within Hindu philosophy, there is a solid and ancient tradition of philosophical speculation on the nature of the universe, of God (termed "Brahman", Paramatma and Bhagavan in some schools of Hindu thought) and of the Atman (soul). The Sanskrit word for the various schools of Hindu philosophy is Darshana (meaning "view" or "viewpoint"). Vaishnava theology has been a subject of study for many devotees, philosophers and scholars in India for centuries, and in recent decades also has been taken on by a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and Bhaktivedanta College. See also: Krishnology</p>
		<p> In Judaism, the historical absence of political authority has meant that most theological reflection has happened within the context of the Jewish community and synagogue, rather than within specialized academic institutions. Nevertheless, Jewish theology historically has been very active and highly significant for Christian and Islamic theology. It is sometimes claimed, however, that the Jewish analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be Rabbinical discussion of Jewish law and Jewish Biblical commentaries.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Theology as an academic discipline</h3>
		<p> The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as old as the history of such institutions themselves. For instance, Taxila was an early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th century BC or earlier; the Platonic Academy founded in Athens in the 4th century BC seems to have included theological themes in its subject matter; the Chinese Taixue delivered Confucian teaching from the 2nd century BC; the School of Nisibis was a centre of Christian learning from the 4th century AD; Nalanda in India was a site of Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD; and the Moroccan University of Al-Karaouine was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th century, as was Al-Azhar University in Cairo.</p>
		<p> The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Christian theological learning was therefore a component in these institutions, as was the study of Church or Canon law: universities played an important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal rights of the church over against secular rulers. At such universities, theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church: it fed, and was fed by, practices of preaching, prayer and celebration of the Mass.</p>
		<p> During the High Middle Ages, theology was therefore the ultimate subject at universities, being named "The Queen of the Sciences" and serving as the capstone to the Trivium and Quadrivium that young men were expected to study. This meant that the other subjects (including Philosophy) existed primarily to help with theological thought.</p>
		<p> Christian theology’s preeminent place in the university began to be challenged during the European Enlightenment, especially in Germany. Other subjects gained in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted to independent reason of a discipline that seemed to involve commitment to the authority of particular religious traditions.</p>
		<p> Since the early nineteenth century, various different approaches have emerged in the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning theology's place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum centres on whether theology's methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment conflicts with academic freedom.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Theology and ministerial training</h3>
		<p> In some contexts, theology has been held to belong in institutions of higher education primarily as a form of professional training for Christian ministry. This was the basis on which Friedrich Schleiermacher, a liberal theologian, argued for the inclusion of theology in the new University of Berlin in 1810.</p>
		<p> For instance, in Germany, theological faculties at state universities are typically tied to particular denominations, Protestant or Roman Catholic, and those faculties will offer denominationally-bound (konfessionsgebunden) degrees, and have denominationally bound public posts amongst their faculty; as well as contributing ‘to the development and growth of Christian knowledge’ they ‘provide the academic training for the future clergy and teachers of religious instruction at German schools.’</p>
		<p> In the United States, several prominent colleges and universities were started in order to train Christian ministers. Harvard, Georgetown, Boston University, Yale, and Princeton all had the theological training of clergy as a primary purpose at their foundation.</p>
		<p> Seminaries and bible colleges have continued this alliance between the academic study of theology and training for Christian ministry. There are, for instance, numerous prominent US examples, including Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, The Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Criswell College in Dallas, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, Dallas Theological Seminary, North Texas Collegiate Institute in Farmers Branch, Texas  and The Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Theology as an academic discipline in its own right</h3>
		<p> In some contexts, scholars pursue theology as an academic discipline without formal affiliation to any particular church (though members of staff may well have affiliations to churches), and without focussing on ministerial training. This applies, for instance, to many university departments in the United Kingdom, including the Faculties of Divinity at the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Exeter, and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Leeds. Traditional academic prizes, such as the University of Aberdeen's Lumsden and Sachs Fellowship, tend to acknowledge performance in theology (or divinity as it is known at Aberdeen) and in religious studies.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Theology and religious studies</h3>
		<p> In some contemporary contexts, a distinction is made between theology, which is seen as involving some level of commitment to the claims of the religious tradition being studied, and religious studies, which by contrast is normally seen as requiring that the question of the truth or falsehood of the religious traditions studied be kept outside its field. Religious studies involves the study of historical or contemporary practices or of those traditions' ideas using intellectual tools and frameworks that are not themselves specifically tied to any religious tradition and that are normally understood to be neutral or secular. In contexts where 'religious studies' in this sense is the focus, the primary forms of study are likely to include:</p>
		<p> • Anthropology of religion</p>
		<p> • Comparative religion</p>
		<p> • History of religions</p>
		<p> • Philosophy of religion</p>
		<p> • Psychology of religion</p>
		<p> • Sociology of religion</p>
		<p> Sometimes, theology and religious studies are seen as being in tension, and at other times, they are held to coexist without serious tension. Occasionally it is denied that there is as clear a boundary between them.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Criticism</h4>
		<p> There is an ancient tradition of skepticism about theology, followed by a more modern rise in secularist and atheist criticism.</p>
		<h3> Criticism by philosophers</h3>
		<p> Whether or not reasoned discussion about the divine is possible has long been a point of contention.</p>
		<p> Protagoras, as early as the fifth century BC, who is reputed to have been exiled from Athens because of his agnosticism about the existence of the gods, said that "Concerning the gods I cannot know either that they exist or that they do not exist, or what form they might have, for there is much to prevent one's knowing: the obscurity of the subject and the shortness of man's life."</p>
		<p> Lord Bolingbroke, an English politician and political philosopher wrote in his political works his views on theology, "Theology is in fault not religion. Theology is a science that may justly be compared to the Box of Pandora. Many good things lie uppermost in it; but many evil lie under them, and scatter plagues and desolation throughout the world."</p>
		<p> Thomas Paine the American revolutionary, wrote in his two part work The Age of Reason, "The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion. Not anything can be studied as a science, without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded; and as this is the case with Christian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing."</p>
		<p> Ludwig Feuerbach, the atheist philosopher sought to dissolve theology in his work Principles of the Philosophy of the Future: "The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology." This mirrored his earlier work The Essence of Christianity (pub. 1841), for which he was banned from teaching in Germany, in which he had said that theology was a "web of contradictions and delusions".</p>
		<p> A.J. Ayer the former logical-positivist, sought to show in his essay "Critique of Ethics and Theology" that all statements about the divine are nonsensical and any divine-attribute is unprovable. He wrote: "It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved... ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical."</p>
		<p> Walter Kaufmann the philosopher, in his essay "Against Theology", sought to differentiate theology from religion in general. "Theology, of course, is not religion; and a great deal of religion is emphatically anti-theological... An attack on theology, therefore, should not be taken as necessarily involving an attack on religion. Religion can be, and often has been, untheological or even anti-theological." However, Kaufmann found that "Christianity is inescapably a theological religion".</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Critics of theology as an academic discipline</h3>
		<p> Critics dating back to the 18th century have questioned the suitability of theology as an academic discipline and in the 21st century criticism continues.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> General criticism</h3>
		<p> Charles Bradlaugh believed theology prevented human beings achieving liberty. Bradlaugh noted theologians of his time stated that modern scientific research contradicted sacred scriptures therefore the scriptures must be wrong.</p>
		<p> Robert G. Ingersoll stated that when theologians had power the majority of people lived in hovels while a privileged few had palaces and cathedrals. In Ingersoll's opinion science rather than theology improved people's lives. Ingersoll maintained further that trained theologians reason no better than a person who assumes the devil must exist because pictures resemble the devil so exactly.</p>
		<p> Mark Twain stated that several mutually incompatible religions claimed to be the true religion and that people cut the throats of others for following a different theology.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> TOBACCO, herb originally from warmer countries, ammoniac, acrid, caustic, narcotic, and poisonous, it has however, artificially and over the course of the past century, due to the weirdness of fashion and habit, become the most cultivated and highly sought after plant, as well as the fascination of nearly everyone who consumes it, be it through the nose in the form of powder; smoked with a pipe; chewed; or by other means.</p>
	<p> In Europe tobacco has been known only since the discovery of America by the Spanish; in France it has been known only since the year 1560. It is said that Hernández of Toledo was one of the first to have sent the plant back to Spain and Portugal. Authors have given it the Latin names nicotiana, petunum, tabacum, etc. Continental Americans call the plant pétun, and those of the islands call it yolt .</p>
	<p> The French have also successively given it different names. They first called it nicotiane, after Jean Nicot, ambassador of François II to Sebastian, king of Portugal in 1559, 1560, and 1561; and minister known by the learned for a range of works, primarily for his French-Latin dictionary, in-folio, a text that our language could not do without. He sent this plant from Portugal to France, with seed to germinate it, which he presented as a gift to Catherine de’ Medici, for whom it was named the queen's herb . This princess was however never successful in getting it called médicée . Tobacco was subsequently named herb of the grand prior, due namely to the grand prior of France from the House of Lorraine who used it a lot; then the herb of the holy cross and the herb of tournabon, named after two cardinals, of whom the first was papal nuncio to France and the other to Portugal; though in the end, it was shortened to simply tabac, following the example of the Spanish, who called the tool they used to shape their pétun, tobaco.</p>
	<p> Its roots are annual; its calyx is either long, tubular, and divided into five long acute sections; or this calyx is short, thick and divided into five obtuse sections. It has a monopetal flower, funnel-shaped, divided into five acute, deep segments, spreading outward from the center; it has five stamens: its fruit is membranous, oblong, plump, and divided by a partition into two cells.</p>
	<p> There are four primary species of tobacco, 1. nicotiana major, latifolia, C. B. P. in French grand tabac and grand pétun, 2. nicotiana major, angusti folia, I. R. B . C. B. P., 3. nicotiana minor, C. B. P., and 4. minor, foliis rugosioribus .</p>
	<p> The first of these species grows a stem to a height of five or six feet, thick as the thumb, round, villous, and filled with white marrow. Its leaves are very broad, thick, flaccid, of a dirty green, approximately one foot long, lacking a stem, villous, somewhat pointed, veiny, viscid to the touch, with a bitter, burning taste. Its flowers grow at the top of the stem; they are a pale red, divided by the edges into five segments, resembling long hollow tubes. Its seminal vessels are long, pointed at the tip, split into two cavities, and are filled with a great number of small brown seeds. Its roots are fibrous, white, and very bitter tasting. The entire plant has a rather nauseating smell. This species’ size diminishes considerably in drying, or as they say in the islands, à la pente ; this shrinking causes the English to think less of this species than of the second. On the other hand, it is the species that is preferred for cultivation in Germany, near Hanover and Strasbourg, because it is less delicate.</p>
	<p> The second species differs from the previous one, in that its leaves are much narrower, pointier, and attached to the stalk by stems that are rather long; its smell is less strong; its smoke is milder and more agreeable to smokers. This species is much cultivated in Brazil, Cuba, Virginia, and in other parts of America, where the English have colonies.</p>
	<p> The third species comes from the French colonies in the West Indies, and it thrives in our climate.</p>
	<p> The fourth species, petit tabac anglais, is shorter and smaller than the previous ones. Its round, villous stems are found at a height of two to three feet. Its lower leaves are quite broad, oval-shaped, blunt at the tip, and sticky to the touch; they are smaller than the leaves of other species of tobacco ; those that grow on the stems are also much smaller than the lower ones, and are arranged in a staggered fashion. Its flowers are hollow and funnel-shaped; its leaves are divided into five segments around the edge; they are a yellowish green, and are situated in a villous calyx. This tobacco has larger seed than the first; this seed is formed in the seminal vessels; it is planted in gardens and flowers in July and in August.</p>
	<p> All four of the nicotianas of which we have just spoken are cultivated in botanical gardens out of curiosity, but tobacco is cultivated for consumption in large quantities in several places in America, especially in the Antilles, Virginia, Havana, Brazil, near the city of Comana, and it is the last that is called Verina's Tobacco .</p>
	<p> Tobacco also grows throughout Persia, particularly in Elam, Hamedan, in the Carmania Desert, and toward the interior of Persia; this last is the best. It is not known if this plant is native to the country, or if it was transported there. It is generally believed that it was brought there from Egypt, and not from the East Indies.</p>
	<p> Some tobacco comes to us from the Levant, from the coasts of Greece and the archipelago, in leaves that are bound together. It is also highly cultivated in Germany and Holland. Before its cultivation was prohibited in France, it was very common here, and thrived especially well, particularly in Aquitaine, near Bordeaux and Clérac, in Béarn near Pau; in Normandy, in the area around Léry; and in Artois, near St. Paul.</p>
	<p> One cannot help but be surprised that the powder and smoke of a poisonous plant have become the subject of a delicate sensation that is almost universal: this habit-turned-passion, quickly excited great interest in perfecting the cultivation and production of this commodity that was so sought after; nicotiana now represents, because of a widely shared taste, a very extensive branch of European and American commerce.</p>
	<p> Scarcely was it known in the gardens of collectors, when various doctors and lovers of novelty used it internally and externally, to treat a variety of illnesses. They applied it via distilled water and in oil, by infusion or distillation; they prepared syrups and ointments from it, which still exist today.</p>
	<p> They recommended it in the form of powder, or smoked, chewed, or taken in the nose, in order to clear the brain, they claimed, of any excess phlegm. They lauded the application of warm leaves for edematous tumors, painful joints, paralysis, boils, and the bites of venomous animals; they recommended these same leaves be ground up with vinegar, or incorporated with oils to make ointments, and applied externally for maladies of the skin; they also prescribed the smoke, applied to the womb for fits of hysteria; they praised the smoke, sap, and oil of this herb, as odontological remedies; they prescribed the syrup for chronic coughs, asthma, and other maladies of the chest. In short they inundated the public with works praising this plant; some of these were written by Monardes, Everhartus, Neander, etc.</p>
	<p> However, many other doctors, enlightened and guided by a more learned theory and practice, thought very differently about tobacco ’s properties in the curing of disease; they judged with reason that there was virtually no instance where its use should be prescribed. Its pungency, causticity, and narcotic quality are the first proof of this. Its nauseating taste is a sign of its emetic and cathartic tendencies; this flavor that is rather burning and sharp, greatly affects the throat, and also shows its purgative and very irritating tendency. However, while nicotiana exhibits all of these qualities, its foul smell indicates that it works through a sort of stupefaction of the animal mind, much like jimsonweed, although we cannot explain how the plant might simultaneously possess a stimulating and soporific tendency; perhaps its narcotic quality depends on its oily and subtle vapor, these properties also being the reason for the odor of the plant.</p>
	<p> Only the habitual use of its powder causes an agreeable titillation of the nerves of the pituitary membrane. At first it activates convulsive movements, then a milder sensation, and finally, in order to arouse the tickle, this powder must be finer and more penetrating. This is what the retailers have tried to do to sell their tobacco to people who have used it for a long time: they hang it in lavatories in order to make it more acrid, piquant, and stronger; and it must be admitted that the analogy is well-founded. Others put it in amber to saturate it all at once with an ammoniac odor, capable of affecting the organ used for smell.</p>
	<p> Tobacco smoke becomes pleasing in the long-term by the same mechanism; but this habit is more harmful than useful. It deprives the stomach of the salivary juices that are the most necessary for digestion; therefore smokers are obliged to drink much more to compensate for this, and it is for this reason that tobacco supplements the modest rations of unfortunate soldiers in the camps.</p>
	<p> Those who have been advised to employ tobacco as a remedy, in small cones in the nostrils, and to leave it in while they slept, have experienced soon after the bad effect of this herb; because its oily, fine parts, descending into the throat and trachea, cause on awakening, dry coughs and violent vomiting.</p>
	<p> As for the exterior application of tobacco leaves, there are much better remedies for all maladies, for which the effectiveness of this treatment is praised. Its fumigation is very rarely suitable for fits of hysteria.</p>
	<p> Tobacco oil often makes toothache worse; when it clears it up, it is only after having burned the nerve by its causticity. If a few people have soothed their toothaches through smoking nicotiana, they are people who inhaled the smoke, who are inebriated from it. Physicians, who are familiar with the delicate tissue of the lungs, will never be persuaded that the syrup of an acrid and caustic plant might be recommendable for maladies of the chest.</p>
	<p> The decoction made from the leaves of tobacco is an emetic, which is hardly permissible for use, be it in this manner, or as a remedy, with the exception of the most pressing of cases, such as apoplexy and lethargy.</p>
	<p> The distilled oil of this plant is such a powerful emetic, that it sometimes causes vomiting, in putting for just a moment the nose near the vial in which it is kept. A few drops of this oil injected into a wound has fatal consequences, as has been proven by Harderus and Redi in experiments on a variety of animals.</p>
	<p> If some collection of academic writings contains any ridiculous observations praising tobacco, they are surely the memoirs of natural history collectors; though one is no more satisfied by those one finds in the majority of authors against the usage of this plant. A text by Pauli, for example, assures us that smoked tobacco turns the skull entirely black. A text by Borrhy, in a letter to Batholin, tells him about a certain person who had so scorched his brain by dint of consuming tobacco, that after his death all that was found in his skull was a black membranous lump.  It is true that at the time of all of these writings, tobacco had started a civil war among the doctors, for or against its usage, and that they employed the true and false without scruple, in order to bring triumph to their party. King James himself became involved in the quarrel; but if his reign was only incompetence, his erudition was mere pedantry.</p>`,
	wArt: `<p> Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus Nicotiana and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used around the world.</p>
	<p> Tobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant. Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. They can be also consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.</p>
	<p> Tobacco use is a risk factor for many diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.[2]</p>
	<p> Etymology[edit]</p>
	<p> The English word "tobacco" originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word "tabaco". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from Taino, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taino, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552) or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).[3][4]</p>
	<p> However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 to define medicinal herbs believed to have originated from the Arabic طُبّاق ṭubbāq (also طُباق ṭubāq), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, as a name for various herbs.[5][6]</p>

	<p> Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BC.[7] Many Native American tribes have traditionally grown and used tobacco. Eastern North American tribes historically carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item, as well as smoking it, both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.[8][9] In some populations, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.[10]</p>
	<p> Popularization[edit]</p>
	<p> An illustration from Frederick William Fairholt's Tobacco, its History and Association, 1859</p>
	<p> Tobacco plant and tobacco leaf from the Deli plantations in Sumatra, 1905</p>
	<p> Following the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. Hernández de Boncalo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World in 1559 following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as "Los Cigarrales" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (cigarras in Spanish). Before the development of lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the midwakh or kiseru or smoking newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thuốc lào for a modern continuance of this practice).</p>
	<p> The alleged benefits of tobacco also account for its considerable success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, explains that the plant " openeth all the pores and passages of the body" so that the natives’ "bodies are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithall we in England are often times afflicted." [11]</p>
	<p> Tobacco smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.[12][13]</p>
	<p> Tobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.[14]</p>
	<p> In the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. James Bonsack created a machine that automated cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the late-20th century.[15][16]</p>
	<p> Contemporary[edit]</p>
	<p> See also: Tobacco control and Tobacco in the United States</p>
	<p> Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco became condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became encompassed as a cause for cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the lawsuit in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.</p>
	<p> In the 1970s, Brown & Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1. This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine, nearly doubling its content from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to use this strain as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization[17] successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. This led to the development of tobacco cessation products.</p>
	<p> Biology[edit]</p>
	<p> Nicotiana[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Nicotiana</p>
	<p> See also: List of tobacco diseases</p>
	<p> Nicotine is the compound responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco use.</p>
	<p> Tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) flower, leaves, and buds</p>
	<p> Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.</p>
	<p> Many plants contain nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobaccos contain a higher concentration of nicotine than most other plants. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.</p>
	<p> Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores,[18] a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species, and accordingly some tobacco plants (chiefly N. glauca) have become established as invasive weeds in some places.</p>
	<p> Types[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Types of tobacco</p>
	<p> The types of tobacco include:</p>
	<p> Aromatic fire-cured is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and Virginia. Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia, which is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in Cyprus and Syria.</p>
	<p> Brightleaf tobacco is commonly known as "Virginia tobacco", often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the American Civil War, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the War of 1812, demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that Bright leaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop.</p>
	<p> Burley tobacco is an air-cured tobacco used primarily for cigarette production. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.</p>
	<p> Cavendish is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type, but is usually one of, or a blend of Kentucky, Virginia, and burley, and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars.</p>
	<p> Criollo tobacco is primarily used in the making of cigars. It was, by most accounts, one of the original Cuban tobaccos that emerged around the time of Columbus.</p>
	<p> Dokha is a tobacco originally grown in Iran, mixed with leaves, bark, and herbs for smoking in a midwakh.</p>
	<p> Turkish tobacco is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (Nicotiana tabacum) grown in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Originally grown in regions historically part of the Ottoman Empire, it is also known as "oriental". Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco (a typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley, and Turkish).</p>
	<p> Perique was developed in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.</p>
	<p> Shade tobacco is cultivated in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the Puritans referred to it as the "evil weed". The Connecticut shade industry has weathered some major catastrophes, including a devastating hailstorm in 1929, and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.</p>
	<p> White burley air-cured leaf was found to be more mild than other types of tobacco. In 1865, George Webb of Brown County, Ohio planted red burley seeds he had purchased, and found a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look, which became white burley.</p>
	<p> Wild tobacco is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and parts of South America. Its botanical name is Nicotiana rustica.</p>
	<p> Y1 is a strain of tobacco cross-bred by Brown & Williamson in the 1970s to obtain an unusually high nicotine content. In the 1990s, the United States Food and Drug Administration used it as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.[19]</p>

	<p> Cultivation[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Cultivation of tobacco</p>
	<p> Tobacco plants growing in a field in Intercourse, Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p> Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.</p>
	<p> After the plants are about 8 in tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.[citation needed]</p>
	<p> Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of "primings", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.[20]</p>
	<p> Curing[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Curing of tobacco</p>
	<p> Tobacco barn in Simsbury, Connecticut used for air curing of shade tobacco</p>
	<p> Sun-cured tobacco, Bastam, Iran</p>
	<p> Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves, and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the "smoothness" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, and is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer.[21] Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.</p>
	<p> Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:</p>
	<p> Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.[22]</p>
	<p> Fire-cured tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.</p>
	<p> Flue-cured tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke.</p>
	<p> Sun-cured tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in Turkey, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes.</p>
	<p> Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as fermenting or sweating.[23] Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a casing solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.[24]</p>
	<p> Global production[edit]</p>
	<p> Trends[edit]</p>
	<p> Tobacco production in Portuguese Timor in the 1930s</p>
	<p> Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced.[25] According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced.[26] The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%.[27] During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased.[26] China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997.[25] This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004,[28] it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.</p>
	<p> Major producers</p>
	<p> Every year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).[30]</p>
	<p> China[edit]</p>
	<p> Around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land.[31] While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income.[32] As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.[33]</p>
	<p> India[edit]</p>
	<p> India's Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[34] India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers[35] and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India.[36] Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.[37]</p>
	<p> Since 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Mysore, West Bengal, and Rajamundry.[35] Rajahmundry houses the core research institute.</p>
	<p> Brazil[edit]</p>
	<p> In Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity.[31] Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area.[38] In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes.[38] Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco, but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar.[39]</p>
	<p> Tobacco plantation, Pinar del Río, Cuba</p>
	<p> Problems in production[edit]</p>
	<p> Child labor[edit]</p>
	<p> The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work.[40] The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.[41] While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations. In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco[25]) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors.[42] They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.[40]</p>
	<p> Economy[edit]</p>
	<p> Tobacco harvesting, Viñales Valley, Cuba</p>
	<p> Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries.[43] This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%.[44] Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.[45]</p>
	<p> Environment[edit]</p>
	<p> Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field.[46] Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain.[47] Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.[48]</p>
	<p> Tobacco crops extract nutrients (such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from soil, decreasing its fertility.[49]</p>
	<p> Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process.[49] Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.[46]</p>
	<p> In 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.[50]</p>
	<p> Research[edit]</p>
	<p> Several tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum cultivar 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology.[51] Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant.[52] This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.[53]</p>
	<p> Genetic modification[edit]</p>
	<p> Because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.[54]</p>
	<p> Field trials[edit]</p>
	<p> Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.[55]</p>
	<p> Production[edit]</p>
	<p> Currently, only the US is producing GM tobacco.[54][55] The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997.[56]:3 In the US, cigarettes made with GM tobacco with reduced nicotine content are available under the market name Quest.[55]</p>
	<p> Consumption[edit]</p>
	<p> Further information: Tobacco products</p>
	<p> Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:</p>
	<p> Beedi are thin, often flavoured cigarettes from India made of tobacco wrapped in a tendu leaf, and secured with coloured thread at one end.</p>
	<p> Chewing tobacco is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, which led to the development of the spittoon.</p>
	<p> Cigars are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which are ignited so their smoke may be drawn into the smokers' mouths.</p>
	<p> Cigarettes are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled into a paper cylinder.</p>
	<p> Creamy snuffs are tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as mishri in some parts of Maharashtra.</p>
	<p> Dipping tobaccos are a form of smokeless tobacco. Dip is occasionally referred to as "chew", and because of this, it is commonly confused with chewing tobacco, which encompasses a wider range of products. A small clump of dip is 'pinched' out of the tin and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. Some brands, as with snus, are portioned in small, porous pouches for less mess.</p>
	<p> Gutka is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.</p>
	<p> Heat-not-burn tobacco products heat rather than burn tobacco to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine.</p>
	<p> Hookah is a single- or multistemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for smoking. Hookahs were first used in India and Persia;[57] the hookah has gained immense popularity, especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or moassel, a mixture of tobacco, flavouring, and honey or glycerin.</p>
	<p> Kreteks are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring "sauce". It was first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal eugenol of cloves to the lungs.</p>
	<p> Roll-your-own, often called 'rollies' or 'roll-ups', are relatively popular in some European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually cheaper to make.</p>
	<p> A tobacco pipe typically consists of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed into the chamber and ignited.</p>
	<p> Snuff is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or "snuffed" through the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff, see dipping tobacco.</p>
	<p> Snus is a steam-pasteurized moist powdered tobacco product that is not fermented, and induces minimal salivation. It is consumed by placing it (loose or in little pouches) against the upper gums for an extended period of time. It is somewhat similar to dipping tobacco but does not require spitting and is significantly lower in TSNAs.</p>
	<p> Tobacco edibles, often in the form of an infusion or a spice, have gained popularity in recent years.</p>
	<p> Topical tobacco paste is sometimes used as a treatment for wasp, hornet, fire ant, scorpion, and bee stings.[58] An amount equivalent to the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a half a teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected area.</p>
	<p> Tobacco water is a traditional organic insecticide used in domestic gardening. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or 'painted' on to the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is, however, banned from use as pesticide in certified organic production by the USDA's National Organic Program.[59]</p>
	<p> Impact[edit]</p>
	<p> Social[edit]</p>
	<p> Smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.[60]</p>
	<p> Following the American Civil War, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. Today, tobacco use is often stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns.[61][62] Bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal.[63]</p>
	<p> Demographic[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Prevalence of tobacco consumption</p>
	<p> Research on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. An estimated 1.1 billion people, and up to one-third of the adult population, use tobacco in some form.[64] Smoking is more prevalent among men[65] (however, the gender gap declines with age),[66][67] the poor, and in transitional or developing countries[68]</p>
	<p> Rates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries.[69] Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults.[70] In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.[71]</p>
	<p> Harmful effects of tobacco and smoking[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Health effects of tobacco</p>
	<p> See also: List of additives in cigarettes</p>
	<p> Tobacco smoking poses a risk to health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke such as Carbon Monoxide, Cyanide, and Carcinogens which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and Cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally.[72] The WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004[73] and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century.[74] Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide."[75]</p>
	<p> The harms caused by inhalation of poisonous chemicals such as Carbon Monoxide in tobacco smoke include diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancers). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances present in tobacco smoke.</p>
	<p> Inhaling secondhand tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.[76]</p>
	<p> The addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of enforcement value.[77] Nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids on drug effect questionnaire liking scales, which are a rough indicator of addictive potential.[78] Users may develop tolerance and dependence.[79][80] Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to the harmful effects of smoking.[81] Tobacco's overall harm to user and self score as determined by a multi-criteria decision analysis was determined at 3 percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking 6th most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.[82]</p>
	<p> Polonium 210 is a natural contaminant of tobacco, providing additional evidence for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer.[83] It is also extremely toxic, with one microgram being enough to kill the average adult (250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight).[84]</p>
	<p> Economic[edit]</p>
	<p> [icon]	This section needs expansion with: discussion of the impact on the poor, taxation, and so forth. You can help by adding to it. (January 2009)</p>
	<p> "Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor", and of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies.[68]</p>
	<p> Smoking of tobacco is practised worldwide by over one thousand million people. However, while smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women's smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.[85]</p>
	<p> In Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of households' expenditure in low-income homes is on tobacco. The poorest 20% of households in Mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.[86]</p>
	<p> Advertising[edit]</p>
	<p> Main article: Tobacco advertising</p>
	<p> Tobacco advertising of tobacco products by the tobacco industry is through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. It is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.</p>

	<p> This vast land is also called Little Russia, Red Russia, and better yet the Province of Kiev; it is crossed by the Dnieper, which the Greeks called Borysthenes. The difference between these two names, the one difficult to pronounce, the other pleasing to the ear, allows one to note, with a hundred other pieces of evidence, the roughness of all the ancient peoples of the north, and the grace of the Greek language.</p>
	<p> The capital, Kiev, previously called Kisow, was constructed by the emperors of Constantinople, who established a colony there; one can still see Greek inscriptions from 1,200 years ago: it is the only city with any bit of antiquity, in these countries where men have lived so many centuries without building walls. It was here that the great dukes of Russia made their residence, in the 11th century, before the Tatars enslaved Russia.</p>
	<p> The Ukrainians that we call Cossacks are a miscegenation of ancient Rhoxolani, Sarmatian, and Tatar peoples. This land was a part of ancient Scythia. Rome and Constantinople, who dominated over so many nations, could not possibly rival Ukrainein terms of fertility. Nature does its best to equip men well here, though they have done nothing to serve nature, subsisting on fruits produced in a soil as uncultivated as it is fertile, and more often living by plunder, enamored to excess of a good preferable to all others, freedom; meanwhile having been successively under the rule of Poland and Turkey. Finally, they affirmed their loyalty to Russia in 1654, without submitting themselves much, and Peter subdued them.</p>

At the head of these ten regiments was a leader elected by a plurality of votes, named Hetman or Itman. This captain of the nation did not have supreme power. Today, it is a court noble that the sovereigns of Russia assign to them as itman; he is really a provincial governor similar to our governors from the pays d’états that still have some privileges.</p>

	eArt: `<p> University, collective term applied to an assemblage of many colleges established in a town, where there are professors of different sciences, appointed to teach students, and where one takes degrees or certificates of studies in the various faculties.</p>
	<p> In each university four sciences are ordinarily taught, that is theology, law, medicine, and the humanities or arts, which include also philosophy. In France there are nonetheless some universities where degrees are taken only in some faculties, for instance at Orleans and at Valence in law, and at Montpellier in medicine.</p>
	<p> They are called universities or universal schools because it is assumed that the four faculties make up the university of studies, or comprise all those studies that can be pursued.</p>
	<p> Universities began to form in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. That of Paris and that of Bologna in Italy claim that they are the first to have been established in Europe; but they were not then as extensive as are the universities of our time. </p>
	<p> One began usually by studying the arts as introductions to the sciences, and these arts were grammar, dialectics, and everything we call humanities and philosophy. From there one rose to the higher faculties, which were physics or medicine, law or civil law, canon law, that is the Decretum of Gratian, and the papal decretals. Theology which then consisted in the Master of Sentences [2] and then in the Summa of St Thomas. The popes exempted these bodies of doctors and students from common jurisdiction, and gave them authority over all the members of their body, of whichever diocese and whichever nation they were; and to those they had examined and made doctors, the power of teaching in all Christendom. Kings also took them under their protection; and unless they were clerks, the members of these universities were exempt from secular jurisdiction. They [the kings] gave them also the right of commitimus, and exemption from public charges. Lastly, the portion of benefits that were destined for graduates contributed to populating universities, and to instituting new ones in all parts of Europe.</p>
	<p> It is said that the University of Paris was born under Charlemagne, and that it owed its origin to four Englishmen, disciples of the venerable Bede; that these Englishmen having resolved to go to Paris to make themselves known, they gave their first lessons in the places that Charlemagne assigned to them. That is the opinion of Gaguin, of Gille, of Beauvai, etc. but contemporary authors, like Eginard, Almo, Regino, Sigeber, etc. do not make the least mention of this fact. On the contrary, Pasquier, du Tillet, etc. expressly assure, that the foundations of this university were laid only under the reigns of Louis the Young, and Philip Augustus, in the twelfth century. The one who first spoke about it is Rigord, the contemporary of Peter Lombard, the Master of Sentences, and the principal ornament of the University of Paris, in memory of whom the bachelors who are studying for their first degree are obliged to assist every year, on the day of St Peter, to a service in the church of St Marcellus, the site of his tomb.</p>
	<p> It is certain that the University of Paris was not at first established in the manner in which it is today, and it seems that in the beginning it was only a public school, kept in the cathedral of Paris; that this university only became a regular body by degrees, and under the continuous protection of the kings of France.</p>
	<p> Du Boulay, who has written a very long history of the University of Paris, has adopted the old and uncertain, not to say fabulous, traditions that extend the origin back to the time of Charlemagne. It is true that that prince re-established the monastic and episcopal schools, and that he even founded one in his palace; but there is no certain evidence that he established a university in Paris. It was only at the end of the eleventh century that Geoffrey of Bologna [1061-, Chancellor of France and Bishop of Paris, formed the secular schools where Guillaume de Champeaux, and after him Abelard [1079-1142], taught rhetoric, dialectics, and theology. They had successors, and emulation, which introduced itself as much among the teachers as among the students. Having made the school of Paris flourish during the twelfth century, it attracted at the beginning of the thirteenth century the attention and the benefits of our kings and of the sovereign pontiffs. Its first statutes were drawn by Robert de Corcéon, legate of the Holy See, in 1215. But at that time it was still composed of artists who taught the arts and philosophy, and of theologians who commented on Peter Lombard’s Book of Sentences, and explained Scripture. Yet from then on Paris had teachers of civil law and medicine. Soon after they were joined to the other two faculties: Gregory IX, in his bull of the year 1231, mentions teachers of theology, of law, physicians (that is how doctors were called then), and artists: this form has always subsisted since, and still subsists today; and the division of the Faculty of Arts into four departments was introduced around the year 1250. The Rector, who in the beginning headed this faculty, became the head of the whole university . He is called, in an edict of Saint Louis, capital parisiensium scholarium [head of the scholars of Paris] , and can only be chosen in the Faculty of Arts. He is elected and can be changed every trimester. But the university has other, permanent officers, that is the two chancellors, the property manager, the clerk; it has eleven colleges in full operation, without counting the Schools of Theology, of Law, and of Medicine; its staff enjoy many privileges, as well as its students, to whom the king has provided free instruction, assigning fixed fees to professors. The important services that this body has rendered and continues to render every day to the state and to religion, must make it equally dear to both.</p>
	<p> The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge can dispute the merit of antiquity to all the universities of the world.</p>
	<p> The university colleges of Balliol and Merton, at Oxford, and the College of St Peter at Cambridge, were all founded in the thirteenth century, and one can say that there are no older establishments of that kind in Europe. Although University College at Cambridge was a place frequented by students since 872, it was nonetheless not a college in form, any more than any other old colleges beyond the sea of Great Britain; they resembled the University of Leiden, where students are not distinguished by particular clothing, lodge only in townhouses where they pay a pension, and only meet in certain meeting-places, which are schools where debate takes place and where lectures are heard.</p>
	<p> With time, houses were built, so that students could live together, yet in such a way that each ran up his own bill, and paid it as if at the inn, as still do today those who live in the law colleges in London. These buildings were once called hostelries or inns, but today they are called halls. See Inn, Hall</p>
	<p> Finally solid revenues were attached to most of these halls, on condition that the administrators would provide nourishment, clothing, and other needs of life to a certain number of students. This changed the name of hall into that of college . See College.</p>
	<p> The same thing happened in the University of Paris, where the colleges are still as many little communities composed of a certain number of scholarships or places for poor students, under the direction of a master or principal. The first were hospices for the religious who came to study at the university, so that they could live together separated from the laymen. Many others were then founded for poor students who had nothing with which to subsist outside their home, and most of them are attached to some dioceses. The students of each college lived in common, under the direction of a headmaster or principal, who looked after their studies and their morals, and they went to take their lessons at the public schools; and that is what is still done in most of those little colleges that are not fully operational.</p>
	<p> The universities of Oxford and Cambridge are governed by the king’s immediate authority, by a chancellor who presides over the administration of the entire university , and who takes care of maintaining its privileges and immunities. See Chancellor.</p>
	<p> This chancellor has under him a great head waiter, who helps the chancellor and the other university staff to accomplish their functions when required, and to judge major affairs in conformity with the laws of the kingdom and the privileges of the university.</p>
	<p> The third office is that of vice-chancellor, who executes the functions of the chancellor in the absence of that leader.</p>
	<p> There are also two public prosecutors who help to govern the university , especially in regard to scholastic exercises, the taking of degrees, the punishment of those who violate the statutes, etc.</p>
	<p> Finally there are a public orator, a guard of the archives, a clerk, parish clerk, and a candle carrier.</p>
	<p> Regarding the degrees taken in each faculty, and the exercises that are done to succeed in them.</p>`,

	eArt: `<p> Wisdom consists in fulfilling with exactitude the duties one has to God as well as to oneself and to other men. But where, other than in the awareness of our immortality, will it [wisdom → ] find reasons for being faithful to those obligations? Thus, the truly wise man is an immortal man, a man who survives himself and who projects his hopes beyond death.</p>
	<p> If we limit ourselves to the narrow circle of the concerns of this world, we find that the strength that prevents us from becoming misers arises from our fear of doing harm to our honor through the baseness of self-interest. The strength preventing us from being wasteful arises from fear of financial ruin, as when we aspire to gain the esteem of others through our generosity. Fear of illness enables us to resist the temptations of sensual pleasure. Self-esteem renders us moderate and circumspect, and pride moves us to appear humble and modest. But the above program merely entails passing from one vice to another. In order to give our soul the strength necessary to rise above one weakness without lapsing into another, its action must be occasioned by reasons that are altogether superior. The considerations of one’s era are capable of moving the soul to sacrifice one passion to another; but the consideration of eternity alone contains reasons that are of a kind to raise the soul above all weaknesses.</p>
	<p> There have been orators capable of sublime eloquence who produced no effect whatsoever because they did not know how to interest, as one must, immortal nature. On the other hand, there have been orators of extremely mediocre talent who moved everyone with plain speeches, because they approached men from the perspective of eternity. It is in the feeling we have of our immortality that we find the source of everything that consoles us, that elevates us, and that satisfies us. The immortal man alone is able to brave death: he alone is able to rise above all of the events of this world and demonstrate that he is not subject to destiny’s caprices and is, as well, more noble than all of the world’s dignitaries. What a lack of harmony there is between the Stoics’ principles and the extravagant apathy that they attribute to their wise men! In your confinement of the wise man to the closed world of fragile and perishable things, what do you require of him? What motive do you furnish to him so that he becomes superior to things that bring him pleasure? Born to be happy and finding happiness only in the delightful feelings he experiences, man cannot renounce one pleasure unless a greater one takes its place.</p>
	<p> If he sacrifices his pleasure to a sterile virtue, a virtue that leaves the soul in indolent inaction and with nothing to occupy it, this sacrifice is no more than the vain ostentation of chimerical grandeur. Have the sage confront himself directly so that he has no other witness of his behavior than himself and so that the flattering murmur of praise does not reach him in his personal desert; oblige this glumly virtuous man to wrap himself in his own merit and to depend on himself alone; you will soon recognize that all this splendor of wisdom → was simply a stately arrogance, which falls of its own weight when there are no more admirers. With what kind of boldness do you expect a sage of this sort to confront life’s risks?</p>
	<p> Who can compensate him for a death that in removing all awareness destroys this very wisdom that is his honor? But were you to suppose that man is immortal, you would see that he is then more noble than everything that surrounds him. The only thing he values in man is man himself. The injustices of other men scarcely affect him. These injustices cannot harm his immortality; his hatred alone could do it harm. This hatred extinguishes the torch. Mortal man is able to simulate a steadfastness that he does not have in order to have others believe that he is above adversity. This disposition ill befits a man who has all of his resources circumscribed in time. But such a disposition completely befits the man who feels made for eternity. He does not simulate what he is not in order to appear magnanimous; instead, nature and religion elevate him sufficiently in order to have him suffer without impatience and be happy without affectation. Such a man can fulfill the idea and the blueprint of supreme merit when his duty requires him to expose himself to the dangers of war. The world will see in him a man whose courage is motivated by reason; his valor will not owe all of its force to an intellectual torpor that blinds him to the precipice gaping below his feet, to the example requiring him to follow others into the worst perils, or to what the world thinks and which does not allow him to retreat from where honor summons. The immortal man exposes himself to death because he knows fully that he cannot die. There are no heroes in the world because there is not one who does not fear death or who does not owe his intrepidity to his own weakness. In order to be courageous, one ceases to be a man, and in order to face death, one begins to forget the self; but the immortal man confronts danger because he knows himself. Heroism, as defined according to the principles of a man who places all of his hopes in this world, is an extravagance. The praise of posterity, for which he exchanges his life, is not sufficient to compensate this loss. How in the world and based on what miracle have men who seem to have known no other life than the present one been able to consent to die in order to be happy. Cicero believed that the principle of this kind of heroism was always a secret hope of enjoying one’s reputation from within one’s very tomb. But there is something more. It is not impossible that these celebrated men gained more happiness from death than from life. Admired by their friends and compatriots, such men were persuaded that they would be as well even by their enemies and by posterity; this thick host of so many admirers was able, for those with fertile imaginations, to compose a spectacle whose charm, although of short duration, was for them of greater value than their own life. The love one has for oneself, enlightened by reason, will never consent to such a sacrifice: it is only thanks to the bursts of a captivated and bewitched imagination that love of self will give its approval.</p>
	<p> One must, observes Seneca, learn everyday how to take leave of the self; one must learn how to die. This idea, which is so noble and so lofty when spoken by a Christian, seems absolutely ridiculous when expressed by a Stoic. He [Seneca] had neither the slightest fear nor the slightest hope of another life. Why, then, did he impose upon himself such a rigorous obligation? Why did he flee pleasures that attracted him, he who, at the moment of death, was destined to enter paradise? [1] What advantage did the obscure philosopher have, he who was always full of lugubrious thoughts and always obliged to restrain himself? What advantage did he have over the likeable and beloved libertine, who was pleased with his happiness and ingenious in his search for pleasure? The same fate awaited each. Men’s lives pass too quickly to be spent in the pursuit of an inflexible and unrelenting virtue. We cannot be too ardent in our search for happiness, and the present is the only means available for reaching bliss, at least the kind that we can attain in this world. Taming one’s passions, ceaselessly practicing self-control, renouncing one’s fondest desires, correcting one’s mistakes, scrupulously monitoring one’s behavior: these activities are all the occupation of a man who peers beyond this life, a man who knows from Revelation that he will survive the loss of his body. But the Stoics did not have the same reasons for holding such a belief; for them, an obscure future never took the place of the present, and the present was their only thing of value, the object of all of their desires. Thus it was that the Greek philosophers, who spoke in conformity with their heart, had a gentle moral code, which was adapted to the various needs of society. The Portico alone distinguished itself by an excessive harshness: too much confidence in reason, an abuse of its strength, and courage that was poorly understood occasioned its complete ruin.</p>`,

	eArt: `<p> Witchcraft. A magical, scandalous or ridiculous activity, foolishly attributed by superstition to the invocation and power of demons.</p>
	<p> Spells and curses are never spoken of except in ignorant regions or eras. That is why witchcraftwas at its strongest among us during the 13th and 14th centuries. According to Voltaire, the children of Phillip the Fair made a written agreement promising mutual aid against those who would attack them by witchcraft. A witch was condemned to burn at the stake for having conspired with the devil to help Robert d’Artois. The illness of Charles VI was attributed to a spell and he sought a magician to heal him.</p>
	<p> Once, in London, the Duchess of Gloucester was accused of attempting to cast a fatal spell on Henry VI. Her supposed co-conspirators, an unhappy soothsayer and a demented and sclerotic priest, who was accused of being a witch, were burnt alive. The Duchess was relieved that she was not condemned and was only required to make a public confession and was sentenced to life in prison. The spirit of light and philosophy which has established its dominance on that flourishing island, has continued since then.</p>
	<p> The madness associated with casting spells made new progress in France under Catherine de Medici; it was one of the fruits of her country which she transplanted to this kingdom. There was a famous medal on which this queen was portrayed as a nude between the constellations of Aries and Taurus, with the name of Ebulle Asmodai (a demon of lust) on her head and a sting in one hand and a heart in the other. The name of Oxiel was engraved near the rim. The question was also put to Count Reggieri of Florence, who was accused of casting a spell to kill Charles IX. In 1606 a group of witches were condemned by order of the Parlement of Bordeaux. The famous priest Gaufrédi was burnt at Aix in 1611, having confessed and convinced the judges that he was a witch.</p>
	<p> Finally, it was nothing but the awakening of common sense towards the end of the last century, which led Louis XIV in 1672 to prohibit simple accusations of witchcraftin the royal courts; and if, since then, there has been, from time to time, some accusations of curses, judges have not condemned the accused except as profaners or confessed users of poison.</p>
	<p> La Peyrere, author of Préadamites (but also of a good study of Greenland) was asked why witches were spoken of more frequently in the North than one might suppose. He said that it is because part of the property of all the supposed witches that were killed was confiscated for the benefit of their judges.</p>
	<p> No one pays any attention to the story of one freed slave of ancient Rome except that he was accused of being a witch, who, for that reason, asked to be tried by the Roman people. The fertility of the little plot of land which his master had left him and which he cultivated with care had attracted the envy of his neighbors. Sure of his innocence and not being alarmed at the indictment of Curule the Edile, who had convened an assembly of the people, he appeared accompanied by his daughter. He was a plump peasant, well-fed and well-dressed, bene curatam & vest itam . He brought to the assembly his large fat cattle, his well-maintained and equipped plow and all his tools in very good repair. Then, turning to the judges, he said: “Romans, here are my spells, veneficia mea, quirites, haec sunt.” The decision was unanimous, he was absolved by acclamation and his revenge on his enemies was the praise he received.</p>`,

	wArt:`<p> A woman is a female human. The term woman is usually reserved for an adult, with the term girl being the usual term for a female child or adolescent. The term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "women's rights". "Woman" may also refer to a person's gender identity. Women with typical genetic development are usually capable of giving birth from puberty until menopause.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Etymology</h4>
		<p> The spelling of "woman" in English has progressed over the past millennium from wīfmann to wīmmann to wumman, and finally, the modern spelling woman. In Old English, wīfmann meant "female human", whereas wēr meant "male human". Mann or monn had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone"; however, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, man began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wēr. The medial labial consonants f and m in wīfmann coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element, which meant "female", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife").<p> 
		<p> It is a popular misconception that the term "woman" is etymologically connected to "womb". "Womb" is actually from the Old English word wambe meaning "stomach" (modern German retains the colloquial term "Wampe" from Middle High German for "potbelly").<p> 
		<br>
		<h3> Biological symbol</h3>
		<p> The symbol for the planet and goddess Venus or Aphrodite in Greek is the sign also used in biology for the female sex. It is a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand-mirror or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath. The Venus symbol also represented femininity, and in ancient alchemy stood for copper. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing spirit) above an equilateral cross (representing matter).<p> 
		<br>
		<h4> Terminology</h4>
		<p> Womanhood is the period in a female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence, generally around age 18.</p>
		<p> The word woman can be used generally, to mean any female human or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with girl. The word girl originally meant "young person of either sex" in English; it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a female child. The term girl is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as office girl are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity, the word girl is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the obsolete English maid or maiden. Referring to an unmarried female human as a woman may, in such a culture, imply that she is sexually experienced, which would be an insult to her family.<p> 
		<p> There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term "womanhood" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the menarche; "femininity" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles; "womanliness" is like "femininity", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; "femaleness" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for "human femaleness"; "distaff" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate archaism; "muliebrity" is a neologism (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of "virility", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely "womanhood", sometimes "femininity" and sometimes even as a collective term for women.<p> 
		<p> Menarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs on average at age 12-13. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bat mitzvah in Judaism, or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21), like the Quinceañera of Latin America.<p> 
		<br>
		<h4> History</h4>
		<p> The earliest women whose names are known through archaeology include:</p>
		<p> • Neithhotep (c. 3200 BCE), the wife of Narmer and the first queen of ancient Egypt.</p>
		<p> • Merneith (c. 3000 BCE), consort and regent of ancient Egypt during the first dynasty. She may have been ruler of Egypt in her own right.</p>
		<p> • Merit-Ptah (c. 2700 BCE), also lived in Egypt and is the earliest known female physician and scientist.</p>
		<p> • Peseshet (c. 2600 BCE), a physician in Ancient Egypt.</p>
		<p> • Puabi (c. 2600 BCE), or Shubad – queen of Ur whose tomb was discovered with many expensive artifacts. Other known pre-Sargonic queens of Ur (royal wives) include Ashusikildigir, Ninbanda, and Gansamannu.</p>
		<p> • Kugbau (circa 2,500 BCE), a taverness from Kish chosen by the Nippur priesthood to become hegemonic ruler of Sumer, and in later ages deified as "Kubaba".</p>
		<p> • Tashlultum (c. 2400 BCE), Akkadian queen, wife of Sargon of Akkad and mother of Enheduanna.</p>
		<p> • Baranamtarra (c. 2384 BCE), prominent and influential queen of Lugalanda of Lagash. Other known pre-Sargonic queens of the first Lagash dynasty include Menbara-abzu, Ashume'eren, Ninkhilisug, Dimtur, and Shagshag, and the names of several princesses are also known.</p>
		<p> • Enheduanna (c. 2285 BCE), the high priestess of the temple of the Moon God in the Sumerian city-state of Ur and possibly the first known poet and first named author of either gender.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Biology and sex</h4>
		<p> In terms of biology, the female sex organs are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the secondary sex characteristics are involved in nurturing children or, in some cultures, attracting a mate. The ovaries, in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones, produce female gametes called eggs which, when fertilized by male gametes (sperm), form new genetic individuals. The uterus is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. The vagina is used in copulation and birthing, although the term vagina is often colloquially and incorrectly used in the English language for the vulva or external female genitalia, which consists of (in addition to the vagina) the labia, the clitoris, and the female urethra. The breast evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live birth. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is probably at least partially the result of sexual selection. (For other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women, see man.)</p>
		<p> During early fetal development, embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral. As in cases without two sexes, such as species that reproduce asexually, the gender-neutral appearance is closer to female than to male. A fetus usually develops into a male if it is exposed to a significant amount of testosterone (typically because the fetus has a Y chromosome from the father). Otherwise, the fetus usually develops into a female, typically when the fetus has an X chromosome from the father, but also when the father contributed neither an X nor Y chromosome. Later at puberty, estrogen feminizes a young woman, giving her adult sexual characteristics.</p>
		<p> An imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses. Most women have the karyotype 46,XX, but around one in a thousand will be 47,XXX, and one in 2500 will be 45,X. This contrasts with the typical male karotype of 46,XY; thus, the X and Y chromosomes are known as female and male, respectively. Because humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from the mother's ovum, genetic studies of the female line tend to focus on mitochondrial DNA.</p>
		<p> Whether or not a child is considered female does not always determine whether or not the child later will identify themselves that way (see gender identity). For instance, intersex individuals, who have mixed physical and/or genetic features, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. At birth, babies may be assigned a gender based on their genitalia. In some cases, even if a child had XX chromosomes, if they were born with a penis, they were raised as a male. There are also transgender and transsexual women, who were assigned as male at birth, but identify as women; there are varying social, legal, and individual definitions with regard to these issues (see trans woman).</p>
		<p> Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), because of a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age. Women typically have a longer life expectancy than men. This is due to a combination of factors: genetics (redundant and varied genes present on sex chromosomes in women); sociology (such as the fact that women are not expected in most modern nations to perform military service); health-impacting choices (such as suicide or the use of cigarettes, and alcohol); the presence of the female hormone estrogen, which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women; and the effect of high levels of androgens in men. Out of the total human population in 2015, there were 101.8 men for every 100 women.</p>
		<p> Girls' bodies undergo gradual changes during puberty, analogous to but distinct from those experienced by boys. Puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilisation. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads-either the ovaries or the testes. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sexual organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal, physical differences between boys and girls are the genitalia, the penis and the vagina. Puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 10–16, but these ages differ from girl to girl. The major landmark of girls' puberty is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13.</p>
		<p> Most girls go through menarche and are then able to become pregnant and bear children. This generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through sexual intercourse, though artificial insemination or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see reproductive technology). The study of female reproduction and reproductive organs is called gynaecology.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Health</h4>
		<p> Women's health refers to health issues specific to human female anatomy. There are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as lupus. Also, there are some gender-related illnesses that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., breast cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer. Women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond to medical treatment differently. This area of medical research is studied by gender-based medicine.</p>
		<p> The issue of women's health has been taken up by many feminists, especially where reproductive health is concerned. Women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the World Health Organisation, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.</p>
		<p> Maternal mortality or maternal death is defined by WHO as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes." About 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. More than half of them occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third in South Asia. The main causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth), infections (usually after childbirth), pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, unsafe abortion, and pregnancy complications from malaria and HIV/AIDS. Most European countries, Australia, as well as Japan and Singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth, while Sub-Saharan countries are the most dangerous.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Reproductive rights and freedom</h4>
		<p> Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has stated that:</p>
		<p> (...) the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences.</p>
		<p> Violations of reproductive rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization and forced abortion.</p>
		<p> Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries. Forced sterilization and forced abortion are reported to be currently practiced in countries such as Uzbekistan and China.</p>
		<p> The lack of adequate laws on sexual violence combined with the lack of access to contraception and/or abortion are a cause of enforced pregnancy (see pregnancy from rape).</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Culture and gender roles</h4>
		<p> In many prehistoric cultures, women assumed a particular cultural role. In hunter-gatherer societies, women were generally the gatherers of plant foods, small animal foods and fish, while men hunted meat from large animals.</p>
		<p> In more recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. Originally, starting at a young age, aspirations occupationally are typically veered towards specific directions according to gender. Traditionally, middle class women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, especially working class women, although this often remained an ideal, economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. Many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.</p>
		<p> As changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only "dirty", long hour factory jobs to "cleaner", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded, women's participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.</p>
		<p> In the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. However, throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. However, the inequalities at home stumped women's opportunities to succeed as far as men. Professional women are still responsible for domestic labor and child care. As people would say, they have a "double burden" which does not allow them the time and energy to succeed in their careers. Furthermore, though there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men, a recent research study showed that women focused on issues of morality, fairness, and well-being, while men focused on social conventions. Until the early 20th century, U.S. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, "Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career." (pg. 93).</p>
		<p> Movements advocate equality of opportunity for both sexes and equal rights irrespective of gender. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement, in recent decades women in many societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker.</p>
		<p> Although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News claimed in 2005 that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequity in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Violence against women</h3>
		<p> A young ethnic Chinese woman from one of the Imperial Japanese Army's "comfort battalions" is interviewed by an Allied officer.
		The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women defines "violence against women" as:</p>
		<p> any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.</p>
		<p> and identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs in the family, that which occurs within the general community, and that which is perpetrated or condoned by the State. It also states that "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women".</p>
		<p> Violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by UNICEF, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, and 80% in the Central African Republic. A 2010 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in Egypt and Pakistan, 70% in Jordan, 56% Nigeria, and 42% in Indonesia.</p>
		<p> Specific forms of violence that affect women include female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, forced prostitution, forced marriage, rape, sexual harassment, honor killings, acid throwing, and dowry related violence. Governments can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as stoning (as punishment for adultery).</p>
		<p> There have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the burning of witches, the sacrifice of widows (such as sati) and foot binding. The prosecution of women accused of witchcraft has a long tradition, for example witch trials in the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence. In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. In Saudi Arabia, witchcraft remains a crime punishable by death, and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.</p>
		<p> It is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. This is especially the case with marital rape. In the Western World, there has been a trend towards ensuring gender equality within marriage and prosecuting domestic violence, but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.</p>
		<p> Sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of war and armed conflict, during military occupation, or ethnic conflicts; most often in the form of war rape and sexual slavery. Contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War, rape in the Bosnian War, rape during the Rwandan Genocide, and rape during Second Congo War. In Colombia, the armed conflict has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women.</p>
		<p> Laws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction. In the European Union, sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to directives.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Clothing, fashion and dress codes</h4>
		<p> Women in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, amongst other factors. Different societies have different ideas about modesty. However, in many jurisdictions, women's choices in regard to dress are not always free, with laws limiting what they may or may not wear. This is especially the case in regard to Islamic dress. While certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain hijab attire (such as burqa/covering the face) in public places (one such country is France - see French ban on face covering). These laws are highly controversial.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Fertility and family life</h4>
		<p> The total fertility rate (TFR) - the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime - differs significantly between different regions of the world. In 2016, the highest estimated TFR was in Niger (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in Singapore (0.82 children/woman). While most Sub-Saharan African countries have a high TFR, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to overpopulation, most Western countries currently experience a sub replacement fertility rate which may lead to population ageing and population decline.</p>
		<p> In many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family. There has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even honor killings. In addition, sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen).</p>
		<p> The social role of the mother differs between cultures. In many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see working mother and stay-at-home mother).</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Religion</h4>
		<p> Particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to gender roles, social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the criminal law, or the family law of those jurisdictions (see Sharia law, for example). The relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Education</h4>
		<p> Female education includes areas of gender equality and access to education, and its connection to the alleviation of poverty. Also involved are the issues of single-sex education and religious education in that the division of education along gender lines as well as religious teachings on education have been traditionally dominant and are still highly relevant in contemporary discussions of educating females as a global consideration.</p>
		<p> While the feminist movement has certainly promoted the importance of the issues attached to female education the discussion is wide-ranging and by no means narrowly defined. It may include, for example, HIV/AIDS education. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Literacy</h3>
		<p> World literacy is lower for females than for males. The CIA World Factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). Literacy rates are lowest in South and West Asia, and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
		<br>
		<h3> OECD countries</h3>
		<h2> Education</h2>
		<p> The educational gender gap in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age. While women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.</p>
		<p> There is a common misconception that women have still not advanced in achieving academic degrees. According to Margaret Rossiter, a historian of science, women now earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States. However, although there are more women holding bachelor's degrees than men, as the level of education increases, the more men tend to fit the statistics instead of women. At the graduate level, women fill 40 percent of the doctorate degrees (31 percent of them being in engineering).</p>
		<p> While to this day women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men, they are not being given the same chance to join faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first professional positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.</p>
		<br>
		<h2> Jobs</h2>
		<p> In 1992, women earned 9 percent of the PhDs awarded in engineering, but only one percent of those women became professors. In 1995, 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. Even in psychology, a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Women in politics</h4>
		<p> Suffrage is the civil right to vote. Women's suffrage in the United States was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the US received universal suffrage, with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote; notably Switzerland, where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland; and Liechtenstein, in 1984, through a women's suffrage referendum.</p>
		<br>
		<h4> Science, literature and art</h4>
		<p> Women have, throughout history, made contributions to science, literature and art. One area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of obstetrics and gynecology (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was undertaken by women; from the mid 18th century onwards medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, therefore the practice was largely transferred to men).</p>
		<p> Writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male dominated world could be very difficult; as a result several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. George Sand, George Eliot).</p>
		<p> Women have been composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. There are music movements, events and genres related to women, women's issues and feminism. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the Concise Oxford History of Music, Clara Schumann is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.</p>
		<p> Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands. Women are particularly underrepresented in extreme metal genres. Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, music producing, and sound engineering. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education "... to such a degree that women dominated  during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."</p>
		<p> According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's The Independent, women musicians in classical music are "... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "... to look sexy onstage and in photos." Duchen states that while "here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."</p>
		<p> According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.</p>`

	eArt: `<p> World, we give this name to the collection and the system of different parts that make up this universe. See Cosmogony, Cosmography, Cosmology, and System. World is used more specifically for the earth, including its different parts and people that live there, and in that sense, we ask whether planets are each a world like our earth, that is to say, if they are inhabited. Concerning which, see the following article : Plurality of Worlds.</p>
	<p> In a work entitled the same as this article, Mr. de Fontenelle was the first to claim that each planet from the moon to Saturn is an inhabited world like our earth. The general reason he used is that planets are similar bodies to our earth, our earth is a planet, and so consequently since it is inhabited, so too must other planets. The author refutes theologians' objections by assuring that he doesn't place humans on other planets but inhabitants that aren’t men at all. Mr. Huyghens in his Cosmotheoros printed in 1690, a short time after Mr. Fontenelle’s work, supports the same opinion with this difference; he claims that planets’ inhabitants must have the same arts and knowledge as we, which is not so different from making men of them. After all, why would this opinion contradict faith? Scripture teaches us, undoubtedly, that all men come from Adam, but it means only men who inhabit our earth. Other men can live on other planets and come from elsewhere than from Adam.
	</p>
	<p> Though the belief in inhabitants' existence on planets may seem true, it is not without difficulties, either. First it is doubtful if several planets, among them the moon, have an atmosphere, and on the assumption that they do not, we cannot see how living beings would breathe and survive there. Second, we notice in some planets like Jupiter considerable changing figures on their surface, see Bands, and it seems that an inhabited planet should be more tranquil. Lastly comets are certainly planets, see Comet, yet it is difficult to believe that comets are inhabited because of extreme differences in the sun's heat that its inhabitants would have to endure, from at times being burnt to at other times hardly or not at all feeling the sun’s warmth. The comet in 1680, for example, almost passed in front of the sun and from there distanced itself so far that it will only return in 575 years. What living bodies would be able to withstand that extraordinary heat on one hand and extreme cold on the other? The same applies in varying degrees to other comets. How must we respond, therefore, to those who inquire if planets are inhabited? That we don’t know.</p>`,
	wArt:`<p> The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization.[1] In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the world is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The "end of the world" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts.</p>
	<p> History of the world is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the first civilizations to the present. In terms such as world religion, world language, world government, and world war, world suggests international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of the entire world.</p>
	<p> World population is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, world economy is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of globalization. Terms like world championship, gross world product, world flags imply the sum or combination of all current-day sovereign states.</p>
	<p> The English word world comes from the Old English weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld), a compound of wer "man" and eld "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."[2] The Old English is a reflex of the Common Germanic *wira-alđiz, also reflected in Old Saxon werold, Old Dutch werilt, Old High German weralt, Old Frisian warld and Old Norse verǫld (whence the Icelandic veröld).[3]</p>
	<p> The corresponding word in Latin is mundus, literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek cosmos "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare Midgard), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the chthonic sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of creation as an act of establishing order out of chaos.</p>
	<p> 'World' distinguishes the entire planet or population from any particular country or region: world affairs pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and world history is a field of history that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. Earth, on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.</p>
	<p> 'World' was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them." [4] The earth was often described as 'the center of the world'.[5]</p>
	<p> 'World' can also be used attributively, to mean 'global', 'relating to the whole world', forming usages such as world community or world canonical texts.[6]</p>
	<p> By extension, a 'world' may refer to any planet or heavenly body, especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of science fiction or futurology.</p>
	<p> 'World', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of human experience.</p>
	<p> The world of work describes paid work and the pursuit of a career, in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and academic study.</p>
	<p> The fashion world describes the environment of the designers, fashion houses and consumers that make up the fashion industry.</p>
	<p> historically, the New World vs. the Old World, referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the age of discovery. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in New World monkey.</p>
	<p> Philosophy</p>
	<p> The Garden of Earthly Delights triptych by Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1503) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by Paradise and Hell. The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a disc enclosed in a sphere.</p>
	<p> In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up reality or the physical universe. In others, it can mean have a specific ontological sense (see world disclosure). While clarifying the concept of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of Western philosophy, this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century[7] and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.</p>
	<p> Parmenides</p>
	<p> The traditional interpretation of Parmenides' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in doxa) is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.</p>
	<p> Plato</p>
	<p> In his Allegory of the Cave, Plato distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.</p>
	<p> Hegel</p>
	<p> In Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy of history, the expression Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.</p>
	<p> Schopenhauer</p>
	<p> The World as Will and Representation is the central work of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.</p>
	<p> Wittgenstein</p>
	<p> Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote Ludwig Wittgenstein in his influential Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in 1922. This definition would serve as the basis of logical positivism, with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.</p>
	<p> Heidegger</p>
	<p> Martin Heidegger, meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".[8] The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "world disclosure" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work Being and Time.</p>
	<p> Freud</p>
	<p> In response, Sigmund Freud proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.</p>
	<p> Other</p>
	<p> Some philosophers, often inspired by David Lewis, argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing the world to a range of possible worlds; a view commonly known as modal realism.</p>
	<p> Religion and mythology</p>
	<p> Yggdrasil, a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse world tree which connects the heavens, the world, and the underworld.</p>
	<p> Mythological cosmologies often depict the world as centered on an axis mundi and delimited by a boundary such as a world ocean, a world serpent or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality[citation needed]) is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.</p>
	<p> Buddhism</p>
	<p> In Buddhism, the world means society, as distinct from the monastery. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to enlightenment, and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.</p>
	<p> Christianity</p>
	<p> In Christianity, the term often connotes the concept of the fallen and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the World to Come. The world is frequently cited alongside the flesh and the Devil as a source of temptation that Christians should flee. Monks speak of striving to be "in this world, but not of this world"—as Jesus said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.</p>
	<p> This view is clearly expressed by king Alfred the Great of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the Cura Pastoralis:</p>
	<p> "Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs (Old English: woruldðinga) as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."</p>
	<p> Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of Jesus according to the Gospel of John, e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is Catholic imagination.</p>
	<p> Contemptus mundi is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.[9] This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian Jean Delumeau.[10]</p>
	<p> During the Second Vatican Council, there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions Gaudium et spes, Lumen gentium, Unitatis redintegratio and Dignitatis humanae.</p>
	<p> Eastern Christianity</p>
	<p> In Eastern Christian monasticism or asceticism the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation (theosis). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like Evagrius Ponticus, and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the Philokalia and the Ladder of Divine Ascent (the works of Evagrius and John Climacus are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world transcendence is hesychasm which culminates into the Vision of God.</p>
	<p> Orbis Catholicus</p>
	<p> Orbis Catholicus is a Latin phrase meaning Catholic world, per the expression Urbi et Orbi, and refers to that area of Christendom under papal supremacy. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and Islamic world.</p>`
